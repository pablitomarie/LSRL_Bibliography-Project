The reluctance to introduce theoretical machinery which, unless appropriately constrained, might be too powerful leads to the rejection of paradigmatic and analogical forces in general as explanatory devices. Yet a number of studies have presented cases where it seems that the only reasonable explanation for the observed phenomena is the recognition of the paradigm as an active force. In the field of Romance linguistics, Malkiel (1968) and Kurylowicz (1968) reached such a conclusion for two related historical problems of Spanish and Italian verbal inflection respectively. At the 1970 LSA Winter Meeting, J. Harris (1970b) presented the difficulties involved in stating the applicability conditions of the Spanish Velar Softening rule in verbal forms. The most natural solution would require to give them as a function of a paradigmatic surface constraint. This paper will investigate the same problem in nominal and verbal inflection in Italian where only a minor portion of stem final consonants undergo palatalization and related rules. Although the derivational description of the forms is complex, the surface results correspond to relatively simple patterns of alternation. Besides proposing a revised classification of Italian verbs based on rule applicability conditions, I will argue for a reconsideration of the paradigmatic dimension interpreted as a special case of functional, as opposed to formal, restrictions on rules.",,Generative Studies in Romance Languages,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1979305292&site=ehost-live,1972,10/1/19 20:59,10/1/19 20:59,293-318,293,318,25,,,431 pp.,,,Newbury,"Rowley, MA",,mzh,EBSCOhost,14,<p>Accession Number: 1979305292.

It is an attempt to show that the constraints governing these orders can be accounted for rather interestingly and with some facility by considering such notions as topic and focus. The Spanish data which I will examine here consist of sentences that contain a subject, an object and a verb, with possible and impossible permutations and arrangements of these constituents. I want to suggest that, with basic word order verb-subject-object and with topic and focus marked in deep structure, we can derive all possible surface ordersinvolving these constituents with the following kinds of rules: a focus subject rule which moves the subject to the right only if it is the focus; subject-permutation to the left for topics and constrastive subjects; WH-fronting; dislocation, which copies the topic outside the S; and object-pronoun clitic movement to the front of the verb.

The aim of this paper is to argue that Spanish has no neuter article, but that lo is instead a pronoun. There is, in fact, little reason other than tradition to consider lo an article. It differs from the masculine and feminine articles, el and la, in at least three conspicuous ways. First lo has no plural form. Second, it has no indefinite counterpart. Third, and most striking, it never occurs before a lexical noun, for there are no neuter nouns in Spanish.

It will be my practice also to explain theoretical matters as they come up, rather than to present a separate introduction to the metatheory in anticipation of its application. Among the characteristics of natural language that have led me to doubt certain tenets of existing theories of analysis there are two which hold particular prominence. First there is the peculiar but to-date unexplained relationship between anaphora and passiveness that shows up in Spanish in the so-called pleonastic pronouns and in the variety of passive forms. Secondly, there is the predicative nature of prepositional phrases and conjunctive clauses, known to traditional grammarians when they referred to the noun as the ""object of a preposition""; both Transformational Grammar and Case Grammar slight the importance of these ""function words"" except as surface manifestations of deep features.

The answers which I would like to suggest come from the point of view of the teacher's preparation. It is common to talk about what a teacher does in terms of subject matter and pedagogy. Under subject matter are included such things about the phenomenon of language, his knowledge of the foreign culture, and other things. Since someone who teaches foreign language as a skill never needs to teach linguistics, his knowledge of linguistics as subject matter is useful to him only in the way that calculus as subject matter is useful to a junior high school mathematics teacher. He studies it not because he will ever have to explain it to his students, but in order to gain a global idea of how the search for knowledge proceeds in his chosen field, and of the kind of questions with which the field deals. While there are no doubt many arguments in favor of the language teacher's learning linguistics for this reason, I am not going to advance any of them here.

In addition, he claims that surface structure constraints are of two kinds, global and nonglobal, and that Spanish provides evidence for the necessity of such a distinction. This paper denies the necessity of any distinction between global and nonglobal constraints for Spanish. It can be shown that it is possible to formulate precise surface structure constraints all of one kind -- equally general, simple and consistent in notation -- that will correctly characterize the set of data in Spanish noted by Perlmutter. By broadening the scope of data beyond that considered by Perlmutter, the existence of additional constraints becomes evident. These constraints may be collaped without loss of generality and stated as one constraint accounting for a much wider range of phenomena than could the constraints proposed by Perlmutter. Even if it could be shown that a global-nonglobal distinction was necessary, I argue that the one constraint specifically proposed by Perlmutter as a nonglobal constraint could not be nonglobal.

With a few exceptions, the relatively small number of verbs called ""irregular"" can be grouped into several classes with common peculiarities. We shall be concered here with verbs that have irregular forms in the present indicateive and present subjunctive. No other paradigms will be considered, although some of the verbs studied here have other irregular forms. Among the questions we want to ask about these verbs are the following: To what extent are they idiosyncratic? That is, must their peculiartities simply be noted individually or group-by-group, or are there non-obvious regularities to be discovered? How do these verbs differ from ""regular"" verbs? To what can the irregularity be attributed, in each case, and how is the grammar affected by the existence of these irregularities? What light, if any, can study of these particular verbs shed on the nature of complex inflectional systems in general? From the outset, I would like to stress two points about this paper as a whole: One, it must be taken as a report on work in progress rather than as a finished product; two, it ends with a number of questions whose weight is considerably greater than that of the factual observations, rules, etc., which lead to these questions. I am quite sure that more study of the same and additional data will suggest ways of correcting many details, for example, in the rules given and their ordering, and of deepening the analysis. I am almost equally sure, however, that such modifications of detail will leave essentially unaltered the bearing this material has on certain fundamental questions that I attempt to bring into focus at the close of the paper.

For example, those verbs usually designated as ""radical changing verbs"" have been analyzed without recourse to special lexical markings both by Foley (1965b) and by Harris (1969b). Once these verbs, and certain others, have been disposed of, we are still left with a substantial number of verbs having irregular conjugations which must be accounted for in terms of exception features associated with their lexical entries. Naturally, whether or not a given verb requires a special marking in the lexicon is a function of the set of rules which are formulated for the analysis of the language in question. I will make the claim that, among those verbs which require special marking, given rules proposed in Harris (1969b), there is a large subset whose phonetic shapes can be explained, or at least partially explained, in terms of the informal concept of athematicity, that is, the absence of the theme vowel at a point in the derivation when it would normally be present.",,Generative Studies in Romance Languages,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1979305087&site=ehost-live,1972,10/1/19 20:59,10/1/19 20:59,236-246,236,246,10,,,431 pp.,,,Newbury,"Rowley, MA",,mzh,EBSCOhost,8,<p>Accession Number: 1979305087.

Within each area, I will try to pose the major issues, summarize the arguments that have been presented, that the analysis of French interrgatives is tied up with more general theoretical issues.

A second, much weaker claim is that more adequate theories of language structure, which are capable of capturing generalizations with greater accuracy than earlier theories, may be used to provide improved text materials to help the learner to internalize these generalizations. Since the possibility of basing a pedagogical theory directly on lingusitic theory has been seriously question (Chomsky 1966), this paper will be limited to an investigatiopn of the application of one thoery of linguistic structure to French syntax and the use of the resulting generalizations in the classroom.",,Generative Studies in Romance Languages,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1979304900&site=ehost-live,1972,10/1/19 20:59,10/1/19 20:59,362-375,362,375,13,,,431 pp.,,,Newbury,"Rowley, MA",,mzh,EBSCOhost,0,<p>Accession Number: 1979304900.

In response to his query: How abstract is phonology?, there have been several interesting papers dealing with exotic languages, some of which attempt to demonstrate the need for highly abstract phonological representations. In particular, these researchers show that their respective languages necessitate positing contrasting underlying segments which become totally neutralized at the surface level -- that is, in all environments of occurence, a situation of which Kiparsky was critical. As for the Romance languages, if we are to obtain interesting insights about the morphology, then we too will need highly abstract phonological representations. In support of this view I shall present data exclusively from French. I shall not be overly concerned with total neutralization, for which I cannot find in French a great deal of evidence either for or against abstractness. Instead, I shall maintain that for Romance it is primarily the relationship between the nonlearned and the learned vocabulary which necessitates abstract representations. This peculiarity of Romance is of course due to the fact that much of both lexical strata historically have the same source -- Latin. In this presentation, I shall try to accomplish two goals: (1) to give some idea of the abstractness of contemporary French, and (2) to suggest how such a system was able to evolve historically.

In the first section the author argues that the clitic pronouns developed at a stage that can be cahracterized as SOV, with the verb in final position (generally assumed for Latin), and that the clitic articles developed at a later stage, properly Romance stage, which can be characterized as SVO, with the verb in medial position (generally assumed for the Romance languages). Since present-day forms of Galego-Portuguese dialects and the oldest Castilian records reveal a situation of general enclisis, the second section deals with some of the rules that might account for the basic difference between the Enclisis Phase of the SOV stage and the present day or Proclisis Phase of Castilian. Finally, a concluding section outlines some possible implications of the paper's findings for the theory of language in general. The data presented in this paper are examined in view of some controversial questions of the day: the question of the surface constraint on clitics (Emonds vs. Perlmutter), the question of the so-called pronouns (Delorme-Dougherty vs Postal), and the question of the relation between the syntactic and the phonological components (Bresnan and Maling vs. others).",,"Diachronic Studies in Romance Linguistics: Papers Presented at the Conference on Diachronic Romance Linguistics, University of Illinois, April 1972",,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1976304523&site=ehost-live,1975,10/1/19 23:14,10/1/19 23:14,153-176,153,176,23,,,244 pp.,,Janua Linguarum: Series Practica: 207,Mouton,The Hague,,mzh,EBSCOhost,16,<p>Accession Number: 1976304523.

The claim is that there is a gap, perhaps lexical, derivational, or syntactic between some French words and their English counterparts. English also has instrumental constructions with adverbs and particles, and other causative or resultative idiomatic expressions, similar to the instrumental causative constructions with adjectives. French has few of these constructions. If thsi gap is not coincidental, and a lack of coincidence is suggested by similar gaps in Spanish and Italian, but not in German or Danish, then it must be explained by systematic differences between Romance and Germanic languages. Latin lacks the instrumental causative construction too, further indicating a lack of coincidence for the gap between French and English. In Green (1970), it is suggested that the existence of numerous particle and adverb constructions in the three Germanic languages mentioned above makes it natural that adjectives could be used with instrumental verbs in a parallel causative construction. In this paper, it is suggested that this relationship is a consequence of still to be understood principles of derivational morphology peculiar to the language family, and that the instrumental causative S-V-O-Adj constructions in the Germanic languages have nothing to do with other S-V-O-Adj constructions which are common to both Germanic and Romance languages.

In all cases the historical evolution is straightforward. The changes are completely phonologically conditioned and have been well documented and agreed upon by Romance scholars. I will then look at the synchronic consequences of these processes. Where a phonologically based description is still possible we will see that the synchronic analysis recapitulates the diachronic. But a phonological analysis is not always feasible, so that what may have been phonologically conditioned historically turns out to be morphologically conditioned synchronically, where the morphological description no longer reflects the diachronic story.

The types of repetition are: (1)  simple repetition, (2) repetition with different phonetic manifestation, (3) repetition to different elements, (4) restricted repetition. The  types  of generalization are: (5) generalization of rule, (6) generalization of environment, (7) generalization of environment (morpheme  boundary), (8) relaxation of similarity requirement. We consider  also: (9) persistence of rules. The rules of a language must belong to the set of universal phonological rules. They cannot be created ad hocally and justified by workability or  simplicity. Since  the set of universal rules is a small subset of the set of possible rules, the universal  rules of Language occur repeatedly in particular languages.

Hence many of the processes will be discussed only in enough detail to show the relationship. A more complete discussion of the Latin and Romance  phonological processes which is beyond the scope of this paper can be found in James Foley ""Prothesis in the Latin verb sum""  (Language  1965), ""An interpretation of Lachmann's  Law""  (Proceedings of  the 10th International Congress of  Linguists, Bucharest  1967),  ""A systematic phonological interpretation of the Germanic consonant shifts""  (Language  Sciences 1970).

SQHIDY5I,bookSection,1975,"Agard, Frederick B.","Agard, Frederick B.",,,,,,A New Look at Linguistic Split in Romance,A New Look At Linguistic Split In Romance,"Agard refers to the second and fifth postulates of his article ""Language and dialect: some tentative postulates"" Linguistics 65 (1971) as his starting point. The first of the two states: ""any two coexisting linguistic systems ... are by structural criteria either dialects of the same language or separate languages."" If structural parameters can be developed and validated, then the means of differentiation will have diachronic implications, allowing a linguistic change to be identified as the creation of two or more languages from two or more dialects of one language. Historical linguists have long tried to do this, constructing Stammbaüme on the general look of comparative data, but they have confused the concepts of language and dialect. Thus there are no objective bases for their geneologies. One way the data can impose an empirically determined solution is illustrated, based on phonological data. The second of the relevant postulates identifies the mechanism by which an antecedent language with two dialects splits into two descendent languages. Two languges result when different synchronic rules trigger a restructuring of the set of underlying phonemes in each dialect so they do not meet the criteria of the first postulate of interest here. This split may then be reformulated in terms of diachronic phonological rules. Agard considers the split of (1) Latin into Insular and Mainland Romance, (2) Mainland into Eastern and Italo-Western, (3) Italo-Western into Northern and Southern Romance, (4) Southern into Italo- and Southwestern Romance, (5) Southwestern into South-Gallo, East Ibero-, Central Ibero- and West Ibero-Romance, and (6) West Ibero-Romance into Galician and Portuguese.",,"Diachronic Studies in Romance Linguistics: Papers Presented at the Conference on Diachronic Romance Linguistics, University of Illinois, April 1972",,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1976303926&site=ehost-live,1975,10/1/19 23:14,10/1/19 23:14,11-22,11,22,11,,,244 pp.,,Janua Linguarum: Series Practica: 207,Mouton,The Hague,,mzh,EBSCOhost,2,<p>Accession Number: 1976303926.

The likeliest etyma are Latin barbarus and prauus. Maher also examines the views of semantics held by Chomsky, and by Bréal, Paul, and Jesperson. He argues that there is leakage of semantic features across the syntagmatic axis; that deletion of one of the terms of the syntagma with retention of its semantic reading is possible; that syntax precipitates change in the semantic reading of lexical items; and that, most importantly, lexical items normoally receive their full complement of semantic features only in syntax.",,"Diachronic Studies in Romance Linguistics: Papers Presented at the Conference on Diachronic Romance Linguistics, University of Illinois, April 1972",,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1976303913&site=ehost-live,1975,10/1/19 23:14,10/1/19 23:14,135-152,135,152,17,,,244 pp.,,Janua Linguarum: Series Practica: 207,Mouton,The Hague,,mzh,EBSCOhost,1,<p>Accession Number: 1976303913.

She states that in the same way that non-denotative, 'psychological' factors (such as presuppositions, implications) actually are at the base of many syntactic peculiarities of a language, the changes in the material, cultural, emotional, intellectual space ('context') surrounding a language may have an effect on the language. Thus, since meaning is very much a part of language, context is also a part of it and therefore must be incorporated into any relevant linguistic theory.

Empirically, the etymologist starts from the surface forms and arrives at the underlying forms; theoretically 'elegance' or simplicity but not directionality is the relevant criterion. The mechanism connecting etyma to present-day forms is a function of phonological, semantic, and cultural phenomena, where the relevant development is from culture to meaning to symbolization. The identification of the phonological components is prior: from a posited Latin etymon to a proto-Romance canon to a present-day form. In the process, the concepts of exception and interference are developed. The semantics of the etymon follows according to developments in semantic fields and actual word usage. The language-culture link is studied through linguistic geology, geography, and sociology. In conclusion, etymology is in accordance with linguistic transformationalism, which is only one facet of intellectual history.",,"Diachronic Studies in Romance Linguistics: Papers Presented at the Conference on Diachronic Romance Linguistics, University of Illinois, April 1972",,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1976303845&site=ehost-live,1975,10/1/19 23:14,10/1/19 23:14,99-106,99,106,7,,,244 pp.,,Janua Linguarum: Series Practica: 207,Mouton,The Hague,,mzh,EBSCOhost,2,<p>Accession Number: 1976303845.

Reflexive deletion has long been a prominent trait of Portuguese, but only for a limited set of verbs. The colloquial evidence from Rio, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Goiás suggests a radical spread of this tendency to verbs of widely divergent semantic and syntactic properties. Deletion affects indiscriminately every purported type of se, including its reflexive, reciprocal, indefinite, and intrinsic uses, thus casting doubt on the long-held assumption that a plethora of separate meanings converge accidentally into a single form. Further data from both literary and colloquial registers pointed to a constant meaning, tentatively characterized as 'limit-setting', which links the seemingly disparate contextual variants of se. Finally, the flexibility afforded by markedness theory enables one to appreciate how reflexive deletion does not have to entail the demise of limit-setting. This is a beginning step toward a theory of dynamic synchrony which would reconcile the semantic invariant with inevitable chronological, regional, and social variation.",,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages: 9,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1981004741&site=ehost-live,1981,10/31/19 18:59,10/31/19 19:02,318-330,318,330,12,381,,,,,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,8,<p>Accession Number: 1981004741.

Despite the fact that there is a great deal of evidence that in natural languages there are only two logical operators functioning as coordinators (see Gazdar and Pullum 1976) , i.e. ET and VEL, it is well known that the number of coordinate conjunctions exceeds the number of logical connectives. The purpose of this paper is to present some evidence supporting the hypothesis that, at least in Romance languages, logical operators and logical relations between the connected terms are not always able to explain the difference between conjunctions, and that several phenomena belonging to the pragmatic level--such as expectation and various types of speech acts--are to be considered.",,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages: 9,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1981004739&site=ehost-live,1981,10/31/19 18:59,10/31/19 19:01,299-307,299,307,8,381,,,,,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,2,<p>Accession Number: 1981004739.

This paper considers data from French, but since the facts of causatives in other Romances languages are so similar, I expect that my analysis could by extended to them. I propose that the Reordering Convention (37) be added to the theory of grammar. This convention seems natural, since it allows the reduced, derived structure to assume the canonical form of the simpler structure as produced in the base. In many respects it can be seen to complement Emonds' Structure Perserving Hypothesis.

The first, BC, restricts the interpretation of recoverability and is part of UG. The Biuniqueness Condition formalizes the traditional grammarians' intuition of a correlation between richness of verbal inflection and optionality of the subject. That condition restricts the interpretaion of RC when it comes to tensed sentence subjects. Moreover, it makes interesting prediciton on the relationship between the weakening of the verbal flectional system and the obligatoriness of a subject. The second, LC, also a part of UG, expresses the property of boundedness in a direct way. LC constitutes a very general constraint on subject interpretation. It radically restricts the movements of subject NPs but, unlike NIC, it does not rely on the complex and sometimes even embarrassing system of Case or on the presence of traces at the level of surface structure.

In addition to discussion concerning the structural position of the WH-phrase, Bresnan and Grimshaw have made an interesting attempt to distinguish cross-linguistically those free relatives originating through WH-movement and those like English that they claim are base generated in the NP position. Contrary to this work, however, I argue that the existence of semantic and surface differences makes it necessary to distinguish between WH-ever clauses, which are semantically conditional, and free relatives in the narrow sense I use here, which are not semantically conditional. In this paper, I deal only with semantically nonconditional free relatives. The main body of this paper consists of a study of two types of free relatives, reduced relatives (that which) and headless relative (what), as they appear in Quebec French, Spanish, and Rumanian. Most of the aforementioned work has centered on headless relatives. Since, cross-linguistically, reduced relatives appear to be more common than headless relatives, I believe that a comparison of these two free relative marking strategies will further our understanding of non-conditional free relatives in general.",,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages: 9,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1981004736&site=ehost-live,1981,10/31/19 18:59,10/31/19 18:59,248-264,248,264,16,381,,,,,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,0,<p>Accession Number: 1981004736.

As a weak pronoun, the clitic properties of que are not surprising, and the absence of clitic properties of que diable can be attributed to the fact that it is poly-syllabic. In addition, the assumption that interrogative que (and que in que diable) is not a complementizer seems to fit very well with the observation that its presence obligatorily triggers the inverstion of the subject clitic when it shows up, since the complementizer does not otherwise trigger such an inversion, while a few designated lexical items like toujours and quel do. It has also been seen that the assumption that que was a pronoun for inanimates, and that qui did not belong to the paradigm of inanimates, allows an explanation for the distribution of grammaticality judgements for sentences like (15), (16a), (16b), given the general prohibition of que being adjacent to a subject trace not controlled within its S. The analysis of interrogative que as a pronoun is furthermore reinforced by its use in infinitival direct quesitons. It has also been seen that the ungrammaticality of (17) to (20) does not support any claim about the categorial status of que in these constructions. Finally, the impossibility of que in (the majority of) infinitival embedded questions may be a consequence of the mechanism already necessary to account for (17) to (20).",,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages: 9,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1981004735&site=ehost-live,1981,10/31/19 18:59,10/31/19 19:03,227-247,227,247,20,381,,,,,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,12,<p>Accession Number: 1981004735.

The first problem is that RRCs allow some form of stranding, whearas WH-interrogatives do not.

Instead of adding new constraints to the grammar, I look at the possibility of explaining the facts without the use of WH-movement, and sketch an approach where these constructions are base generated. In conclusion, the difference in stranding and preposition deletion seems to depend on whether the controller has referential content or not.

I propose that a movement rule which applies in direct and indirect questions, and relatives, transports an X-phrase modified by a degree or measure phrase into COMP position. X ranges over nouns, quantifiers, adjectives, and adverbs. The movement obeys the Relativized A-over-A principle (Gresnan 1976a). In certain cases, the degree or measure phrase may be moved in isolation into COMP, in accordance with this principle. In the case of relative clauses, including comparative relatives of the type of (1), a further rule raises a nominal, adjectival, or adverbial structure into the lexically empty antecedent position of the relative clause. The movement can be considered structure-preserving, if the notion of nondistinctness is defined in terms of specified features, but not if defined in terms of unspecified ones. Once the analysis for comparative relatives is presented, I discuss the consequences of my proposal for comparative constructions that have been treated within the context of Bresnan's Comparative Subdeletion (Bresnan 1973, 1975, 1976a, 1976b, 1977). I propose that the analysis postulated for interrogative and relative constructions accounts for the properties of comparatives lacking a measure phrase in the compared constituent. WH-movement places a maximal phrase of type X in COMP. In certain dialects, movement of the measure phrase in isolation occurs in accordance with the Relativized A-over-A principle.

Preliminary evidence from an on-going investigation of spoken usage indicates that gender is used communicatively, in ways that are closely allied to the communicative function of the particular linguistic elements with which gender occurs. In this instance I examine, specifically, the occurrence of gender in the third person oblique clitics--le, la, and lo--in a Castilian dialect in which these elements are used without regard to case. The analysis proposed also raises important questions--among them, the status of the plural los, which it seems may turn out to be different in different caseless dialects. Yet despite its preliminary character, it brings to light evidence of different kinds suggesting that a communicative approach--which has provided revelaing accounts of other seemingly intractable phenomena--might likewise be applied with profit in attempting to explain gender, as it is actually used and understood.

Nontransormationalists, of course, disagreed. It is not until the publication of Chomsky's (1970) seminal paper on nominalizations that an alternative explanation is given serious consideration in transformational circles. In this view by Jackendoff (1972:59-62) it is suggested that at least some attributive adjectives are base-generated in English. In his view, however, the Relative Clause Reduction rule is still needed to derive phrases like the sleeping child. Given the wide acceptance of the transformational analysis of attributive adjectives in English, it should come as no surprise that a similar analysis for Spanish has gone practically unquestioned among transformationalists, although other explanations do exist. The case for the transformational derivation of Spanish attributive adjectives has been made by Cressey (1966) and Luján (1972). In this paper, I intend to show that the transformational analysis is incorrect for all attributive adjectives, which must instead be base-generated. I first argue against the specific claims made in Luján (1972), and then against the transformational derivation of attributive adjectives in general. Finally, I suggest an alternative analysis where attributive adjectives are base-generated as consituents of the Noun Phrase.

In this paper it is shown that traditional definitions in terms of undefined notions such as essential vs. accidental properties, modification and state, are insufficient to describe the use of the Spanish copulas. The choice of copula in a predicate sentence entails an aspectual distinction which is formally defined in the grammar by means of the feature [PERFECTIVE] and two distinct semantic interpretations assigned to the opposing values of the feature. Estar- predicates are perfective and must be interpreted as inherently referring to a delimited time period, i.e. a period of time whose beginning or end is assumed. Ser-predicates are imperfective in that their temporal reference involves an undelimited period of time covering a number of distinct occasions, i.e. a stretch of time with indefininte beginning and end. The formal definition of these two types of temporal reference was shown to characterize correctly the partial synonymy of the copulas, as well as the traditional dichotomy {essential vs. accidental} they are said to express. They also throw light into an apparent lexical gap and the relationship holding between certain inchoative verbs and certain perfective predicates bearing related participles or adjectives. In addition, the analysis provides an account of previously unaccounted structural and semantical features such as the distribution of the copulas with past participles, locatives, frequency adverbs, and time adverbials. It has also been seen that the semantic definitions here proposed are applicable to the aspectual distinction observed in other verbal forms, such as the two preterite tenses. Their distribution and interpretation, and their combination with time adverbs, are consistent with the analysis. What needs to be further investigated is the exact nature of the combinations of perfect/imperfect grammatical aspects with perfective/imperfective types of predicates.

Estar,"The premise of this paper is that sentences like (1) and (2) are existential sentences (ES) which have the function of introducing the rheme. (1) En la esquina hay una polícia. 'On the corner there is a policeman.' (2) En la esquina está un polícia. 'On the corner is a policeman.' The rheme of an affirmative ES is the part of the sentence which falls within the scope of assertion (Givón 1975, Babby 1978 and 1979). In (1) and (2), the italicized portion corresponds to the rheme. Notice also that while in (1) the rheme is the verb plus a direct object argument, in (2) the rheme encompasses the verb plus a subject argument. This fact clearly indicates that the subject/predicate dichotomy is independent of that of theme/rheme. The purposes of this paper are threefold: (1) to demonstrate that indefinite arguments are compatible with both hay and estar; (2) to characterize the differences between the two verbs under discussion; and (3) to show that theme/rheme assignment belongs to sentence grammar.

Section 1 deals with phrasal stress in Spanish, taking advantage of Liberman and Prince's (1977) theory which relates stress and constituent structure. Section 2 deals with word stress in Spanish, about which there has been considerable controversy in the literature. Finally, Section 3 discusses the so-called 'rhythm rule' and cases of stress shift. A metrical analysis of stress in Spanish is proposed here as an alternative to the segmental analyses in the literature. While both frameworks share many strengths and weaknesses, it has been argued that the metrical analysis is able to eliminate the need for certain conventions such as the cycle and the stress lowering device, while at the same time providing an account for alternating secondary stress and stress shift naturally. The metrical analysis, then, should be preferred. Evidence from many other languages, though, is needed in order to finally decide these questions about the primitives of phonological theory.

The truth is that vowel nasalization and nasal consonant truncation in French are natural, whereas oral vowels before nasal consonants are a lusus naturae.

For example, it has been claimed recently by Houlihan and Iverson (1979) that phonological rules which produce relatively marked segments are necessarily allophonic, and conversely, rules which produce unmarked segemtns are necessarily neutralizing. In this paper data from two Catalan dialects, the Standard Eastern and Barcelona varieties, are adduced as a counter-example to their hypothesis. I discuss two different possible analyses of the data: in one analysis, the rule in question is taken to be neutralizing, in the other, it is considered allophonic. It is shown that no matter which analysis is chosen, the Houlihan and Iverson proposal cannot account for both dialects. Finally, it is suggested that Houlihan and Iverson's claim be modified so that it applies only to strictly binary oppositions--rules in which only one feature is affected.",,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages: 9,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1981004721&site=ehost-live,1981,10/31/19 18:59,10/31/19 19:02,24-36,24,36,12,381,,,,,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,4,<p>Accession Number: 1981004721.

His description of the environments in which gliding occurs is very intruiging: It appears that gliding, like liaison in French and raddoppiamento in Italian, can operate across word boundaries (although it is also conditioned word-internally). Liquid gliding occurs when the liquid is after a vowel other than the high front vowel /i/ and is (a) in word-internal position before a consonant; (b) at the end of an oxytonic word, regardless of what follows; (c) at the end of an unstressed monosyllable if followed by a consonant. G. gives evidence to conclude that, instead of this first approximation above, the correct environment for liquid gliding is the disjunction ""before a consonant or a word boundary"" with no reference to stress placement. This conclusion rests squarely on the assumption that articles and prepositions-which would fall under case (c) above-are not ""words"" but perhaps ""clitics"" (loc. cit.); thus they will not undergo gliding before a vowel. I find G. quite convincing in his arguments against stress as a factor and in stating that case (c) above is somehow to be viewed as a special instance of case (a).

7ETRGXBC,journalArticle,1981,"Strozer, Judith","Strozer, Judith",,,,,,An Alternative to Restructuring in Romance Syntax,An Alternative To Restructuring In Romance Syntax,"In one of the bolder articles here Judith Strozer proposes an analysis of so-called clitic-climbing sentences in Italian and Spanish which do not involve restructuring. She claims that CC structures always involve embedded (orphan) VP's, whereas the phenomenon known as CC never occurs with embedded s complements. S. offers no independent evidence for the claim that the relevant V's embed VP or s complements. She then goes on to attack Rizzi's 1978 arguments for restructuring. She argues that R.'s tests for different constituency of paired s's where one has climbed clitic and the other does not are faulty. Against his pied-piping test, she contends that the ungrammatical s can be excluded because the trace of the clitic is not properly bound; thus no evidence for constituency emerges. However, French subject clitics with the same binding problem are grammatical. Second, she argues against R.'s Right Node Raising test, maintaining that the relevant s's could be out because ""there is only one trace for two different clitics"". Third, S. argues against R.'s complex NP shift test saying the relevant s's are out because ""some kind of interference that makes it difficult to relate the clitic to its NP position"" is ""involved"".",,Papers in Romance,,0195-7260,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1981026945&site=ehost-live,1981,10/8/19 18:10,10/8/19 18:10,177-184,177,184,7,supp. 2,3,,Papers in Romance,,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,26,<p>Accession Number: 1981026945.

She considers instances where the D.O. is preverbal and others where it is postverbal, concluding that the degree of ""topicality"" of the D.O. is the relevant factor. When the D.O. is more topical (i.e., more specific as determined by a combination of the two features of having a determiner and being morphologically definite), the D.O. is more likely to appear with an accusative clitic. The author concludes that this phenomenon is a manifestation of object-verb agreement.

In particular, she argues that QM is not allowed out of infinitivals introduced by a preposition but is allowed out of those introduced by complementizers. She makes her point very well with nice contrasts like those in (7)-(9), using clefting, pied-piping of P's in question formation, and the type of clitic that corresponds to an infinitival complement (i.e., y or le) as tests for whether or not a complement is introduced by a P.

Larry King points out that inflected infinitives have the same distribution as uninflected infinitives with impersonal one subject. What he does not state is that this correlation is exactly as expected. That is, infinitives of any type with uncontrolled have a unitary distribution. K's major concern is what motivates the choice in actual usage between inflected infinitives, uninflected infinitives, and embedded tensed verbs where infinitivals are also admissible. He concludes that the tendency is to use a tenseless form whenever the tense of the infinitival is dependent on some other temporal referent in the sentence. Furthermore, there is a tendency to opt for the uninflected infinitive; but K. does not, so far as I can see, attempt to explain why.

Several recent studies have argued for a nonclausal underlying structure for these complements. The problem to be discussed here is how the complement verbs correr and partir are assigned a subject. The presentation will be in three parts. First, I wil introduce Williams' rules of predication, and show how they provide subject-predicate coindexing for a range of structrures not covered by the syntactic subject relation. Second, I will show how predication applies in Romance, which in many instances is parallel to English. Other cases, however, require coindexation between a predicate and a following subject. These are shown to be easily statable in terms of predication. Third, I will show how the same principle of predication. Third, I will show how the same principle of predication applies to the causative complement construction, with respect to lexical, clitic and null subjects.

In section 1, I will propose that the subject pronoun may appear in object position due to the loss of obligatory specification for animacy on the pronoun, and will later argue that this factor, which separates SBP from both LBP and Continental Portuguese (CP), is linked to the possibility of missing object. In sections 2 and 3, data will be presented as evidence of missing objects in grammatical utterances and their possible syntactic properties within the government-binding framework proposed by Chomsky (1979) wil be examined. In section 4 it will be argued that the missing objects are the result of a deleted pronoun. This solution will simultaneously link SBP more closely to the other major Romance languages and provide an answer as to why only SBP shows evidence of this phenomenon among these languages. Section 5 deals briefly with the general subject/object relation in Romance languages allowing a missing object.

Even a furtive glance at the prevailing conditions in the other modern Romance languges, and in particular at the very closely related Spanish, bring the deviance of Portuguese in this respect to the fore. Normally in Romance, the clitic linearization distribution (proclisis vs. enclisis to the host verb) can be described in terms of morphosyntactic categories governing this choice exhaustively. The difficulty with Brazilian linearization lies in the complex sociolinguistic and stylistic layering of the question, oscillating between an insecure E(uropean) P(ortuguese) regulation for most elevated, formal written communication, and the opposite extreme of completely different B(razilian) P(ortuguese) pattern in some spoken registers. In EP the data are rather well circumscribed but they tend to the prescriptive grammar tradition to codify and collect the EP usage; the ensuing 'official' theory, however, cannot satisfy even a moderately sophisticated language user, neither native nor non-native. The remainder of this paper then will be devoted to the investigation and elucidation of the EP linearlization conditions.

In recent years, many aspects of these analyses have been challenged in favor of more traditional accounts. Whereas standard generative accounts typically propose unified phonological treatments for alternations traditionally assumed to be of a non-uniform nature, the new trend typically argues against these unified analyses, and in favor of a split characterization of the alternations. Methodologically, the stronger claims made by the standard generative accounts have naturally come to serve as null hypotheses, the burden of disproof taken up by the more recent generative trend. As a rule, new generative treatments have displaced the domain of argumentation from formal to substantive grounds, from simplicity to psychological reality, and they have enlarged the domain of relevant investigation to include external as well as internal evidence. As an illustration of these general considerations, I wish to examine in some detail the case of the al-o alternation in French. This alternation is a relatively minor aspect of French phonology and morphology, but it constitues an instructive microcosm of current controversies in French phonology and phonological theory.

D.",,,,,,Empirical Evidence for the Markedness of Plurality in Spanish,Empirical Evidence For The Markedness Of Plurality In Spanish,"It is generally agreed that in noun phrases the singular is unmarked relative to the plural. Support for this notion comes from the fact that in the majority of languages in which there is a formal singular/plural contrast, it is normally the plural member of the opposition which is formally marked while the singular is most often conveyed by the absence of any such marking. In addition the notion of plural can be said to be semantically more complex than singular. On the other hand, there is a certain amount of circularity in this reasoning. We define the singular as the unmarked term since it carries no formal mark and then we say that it carries no mark because it is the unmarked term. In spite of this, most linguists would agree that this characterization of markedness in the case of the singular/plural opposition is reasonable. It would be helpful, however, if we could find some sort of empirical evidence that speakers of a language make some use of this notion, that markedness is reflected somehow in their linguistic behavior. In this paper I will examine the speech of a group of informants from the capital city of the Dominican Republic and will show that indeed the notion of markedness does play an important role in their organization of discourse.

Of these, impersonal haber sentences comprise the presentational construction par excellence. That they are the foremost presentational construction is due to several reasons, among which is the rather important fact that they are essentialy restricted to this function. Aside from their discourse function, the common denomincator among the five subtypes is their V NP word order, which makes them subjectless at the level of LF. As already discussed, their subjectlessness has further consequences: they co-occur only with S-negation, and furthermore, they are incompatible with the hacerlo construction.",,Current Research in Romance Languages,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1981026923&site=ehost-live,1981,10/31/19 18:52,10/31/19 18:54,157-165,157,165,8,231,,,,,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,1,<p>Accession Number: 1981026923.

In this study we propose to carry out a comparative examination of another Romance language variety, Ontarian French, in which the 3pl. forms of verbs which maintain a 3sg./pl distinction tend to give way to the 3sg. ones (e.g, ils veulent > ils veut). Ontarian French is a contact variety in the sense that many of its speakers also know and use English to a varying extent, given that Anglophones consititue the linguistic majority in Ontario. The phenomenon under study can be looked upon as a case of variability whereby the 3pl. variable is actualized through two variants, the standard 3pl. verb form or the nonstandard 3sg. verb form. Using quantitative methodology, we set out to provide answers to three basic questions concerning this phenomenon. First, is it conditioned by certain linguistic parameters? Second, is it correlated iwth certain social characteristics of the speakers? And third, how did it originate in Ontarian French?

Recent work with the EST framework has presupposed the existence of the null categories NP[e] and NP[PRO], often without justification. In this paper I shall argue for two claims which constitute the two parts of the presentation: first, that the dummy subject il and on are base generated as null elements, not as lexical items, and are inserted by a late morphological rule; and second that the base null elements corresponding to il and on are distinct from one another, namely NP[e] and NP[PRO] respectively.

Such a category is called a 'trace'. The realtion of co-indexing between the moved consituent and its trace is held to be equivalent to the relation of bound anaphora and we expect the relation to exhibit all the properties apparent in the relation between an antecendent and a reflexive. Fiengo (1977) and Chomsky (1977) contain a considerable amount of discussion of these facets of trace theory. The issue that the present essay takes up is whether or not traces have internal structure accessible to rules of grammar. We might pose the question then, as to whether traces are like or unlike null anaphora in this respect. This essay argues on the basis of the interaction of Montée du sujet and En Avant in favor of a condition which insures that traces have no internal structure. Like the Subjacency Condition, this condition will be argued to hold over movement rules only and hence wil be inapplicable to null anaphora and construal rules.

The present paper is concerned with the bearing of certain evidence from Spanish on the general theory of cyclic phonological rules. Arguments were given long ago that certain phonological rules in Spanish, stress rules to be sure, apply cyclically in certain morphological environments. The implicit claim was that word-level stress rules in other environments, and all rules of segmental phonology, are non-cyclic. This latter claim was not argued explicitly, however, because in those days it was taken for granted that the burden of proof fell on the proponent of a cyclic analysis.  In short, there is no known apriori or methodological argument against cyclic phnological rules, It is a purely empirical question whether and which phonological rules are cyclic. I intend to argue first that certain phonological rules of Spanish, both segmental and prosodic, are in fact cyclic; second, to establish what the domain of cyclic application is in Spanish; and third, to discuss the characteristics of phonological rules that belong to the cyclical, lexical, set.

This notion, however, it not held universally. There are linguists who contend instead that sound change is purposeless, i.e., that it seeks no systemic advantage for the speaker or the hearer. While holding to the latter view, it is possible to recognize at the same time that speakers may consciously or unconsciously alter their pronounciation in a systemic way for some nongrammarical purpose such as seeking or avoiding identification with a certain group or class, as Labov and his followers have shown in their studies. That is to say, the notion that sound change from within the grammar is purposeless does not conflict at all with the Labovian view of socially-induced language change, including change originating in language contact. In this paper, and following the lead of Nigel Vincent (1978) and Roger Lass (1980), I will argue for the nonteleological view of sound change, while agreeing with them and with others (e.g., Postal 1968) that such a view is compatible witht he purely sociological aspects of the Labovian or variationist paradigm.

As a consequence of the demonstrative's relatively weak deixis, its use is often difficult to distinguish from that of the third person pronouns. This is especially true of the neuter demonstrative ce, when it is anaphoric to a specific lexical antecedent. Despite general interest in matters relating to pronominalization, anaphora and co-reference, the problem of the use of the demonstrative vs. the personal pronoun in French remains relatively unexplored in recent linguistic research. And thought the occurrence of ce/il(s); elle(s) as subject forms is frequently mentioned in pedagogical grammars, it is poorly understood. Traditionally, the occurrence of ce as opposed to il(s); elle(s) is seen to be a problem associated with the verb être ('to be'), and the rules that govern the alternation are said to be determined by the predicative complement of être. But as is well-known such rules, which determine the use of il(s); elle(s) vs. ce according to the part of speech of the word occuring in the post-verbal slot, are oversimplifications often contradicted by the facts. It is the purpose of this paper to show that what matters in the selection of a demonstrative rather than non-demonstrative pronoun as anaphoric subject of être is the kind of reference made by the verbal subject itself.

The Kiparskys' article, ""Fact"" 1970, initiated a significant approach in this direction by suggestion that certain syntactic behavior might best be explained by first studying the semantic properties of main clause verbs. Of particular note in their analysis where the semantic concepts of presupposition and factivity. Factive matrices are said to presuppose their complement to be true regardless of whether the main clause undergoes negation or not. These semantic notions were subsequently used by Hooper and Terrell (1974) to construct a systematic explanation for mood selection in Spanish with respect to nominal clauses. This paper will briefly present Hooper and Terrell's analysis (1976) of the Spanish modal system and, then, compare their predictions for mood selection to data collected from 45 Mexico City informants in the fall of 1978 and spring of 1979. The data will show that while their semantically based analysis does predict to a certain degree how the informants will make mood choices, there exists much more variation in mood selection than accounted for in their model.

Anybody with a smattering of Romance philology would be ready to that that there have been voiced stops in French without interruption from the time the late Latin of Northern Gaul could be identified as pre-French. I must therefore try to justify or, maybe, just explain why I speak of a 'new generation'.  The argument goes as follows: people who do not use exactly the same phonemic units are found to understand one another; therefore phonemens may be discrete, if we consider the idiolect, but not if we operate with a language as a means of communication; furthermore, even on the plane of each idiolect, there are cases on record where a given speaker abandons some distinctions he used to make. Since this is not likely to take place overnight, it means that, over a certain period, it was impossible to count the phonemes of the idiolect. The conclusion which is drawn is that a new theoryo should be established, which would not be based upon the concept of discreteness.

This is indicative of the fact that French actually operates with what is, from a traditional standpoint, a subphonemic pattern, and this is a justification of the subphonemic notation originally devised for alfonic and vindicated by the practice of the children.

At least one step towards an explanation of this phenomenon has already been provided by Meyer-Lübke who stated: 'The reduction of the two cases to one, must probably be explained by the fact that the need to separate the singular from the plural was greater than the one to distinguish between the nominative and the accusative' (1894:26). In order to show that, at least for French, Meyer-Lübke's observation was correct, we will take a closer look at the evolution of the Latin case system. Because of limitations of space, we will disregard the stage of evolution in which the synthetic expression of case relations was replaced by the analytic construction preposition + accusative in order to focus on the crucial Old French stage, in which the nominative was lost",,Papers from the XIIth Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1984012752&site=ehost-live,1984,10/31/19 19:31,10/31/19 19:31,579-599,579,599,20,"xii, 611",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 26,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,0,<p>Accession Number: 1984012752.

Inevitably discussions of this topic address three important questions: a. What is the nature of the loss of s in Archaic Latin and to what degree was it lost? b. What is the nature of the reintroduction of s into Classical Latin? c. What is the relationship, if any, between the loss of s in Archaic Latin and its loss in Central Italy and Dacia during the second and third centuries A.D. (and hence its absence in Eastern Romance)? And further, is there any relationship between the loss of s in Latin and its absence from the (historically) second declension masculine substantive in Iberian varieties of Romance? In my opinion the answers to these questions have never been satisfactorily provided, basically because of a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the process deleting final s in Latin. In this paper I propose to discuss the nature of this process, the nature of its reintrodution into Classical Latin, and some implications for Romance.

In the literature these forms have been called past participles, passive participles, deverbal adjectives or simply, verbs used as adjectives. Recent developments in linguistic theory, particularly the work of Freidin (1975) and Wasow 91977) on the passive, have contributed to much debate in the field of Portugese linguistics. Freidin (1975) has proposed that the active-passive relation be accounted for in the lexicon rather than by the passive transformation. Wasow (1977) has propsed two sources for passives: some participles are adjectives generated lexically while other participles are adjectives generated lexically while other participles are verbs, derived by transformation. Both Freidin's and Wasow's opposing proposals have interesting implications for the analysis of Portuguese. Following Freidin, all passives in Portuguese would be lexical; following Wasow, there would be a lexical as well as a transformational passive. It is the purpose of this paper, first of all, to review the literature on the subject of -do participles, and second, to evalute the implications of Freidin's lexical analysis in comparison with Wasow's lexical-passive solution.

LZUK3BVB,journalArticle,1984,"Reider, Michael","Reider, Michael",,,,,,Implications of Neutralization Processes in Portuguese for Phonological Abstractness,Implications Of Neutralization Processes In Portuguese For Phonological Abstractness,"To limit abstactness in phonological theory (i.e. the degree to which underlying forms may differ from their corresponding surface forms), Kiparsky (1968) proposed that the Alternation Condition should be adopted. It stated as follows: Neutralization processes cannot apply to all occurrences of a morpheme. In 1973, however, Kiparsky rejected his earlier proposal in favor of a universal global constraint on the application of phonological rules (rather than on the choice of underlying forms). It stated: Neutralization processes apply only to derived forms. Both of Kiparsky's proposals described above exclude analyses incorporating a rule of absolute neutralization, and therefore either one, if adopted, would limit abstractness in phonological theory. It is shown in this paper, however, that there is a well motivated concrete analysis of nasal diphthongs in Brazilian Portuguese which, if correct, provides sufficient grounds for rejecting both Kiparsky's 1968 condition on abstractness as well as his 1973 reformulation of that proposal. Specifically, there are two neutralization rules in this analysis (Back Glide Formation [BGF] and Front Glide Formation [FGF]), which, contrary to Kiparsky's 1968 claim, apply to all occurrences of a morpheme; and there are two other neutralization rules (Nasalization [NAS] and Denasalization [DENAS]) which apply to non-derived forms, in violation of Kiparsky's 1973 constraint.

Two aspects of the subject have been discussed either seperately or together in the literature: negative polarity items (NPI) and negative polarity triggers. Negative polarity items were first defined in English as a diverse group of adverbs, adjectives, and idiomatic expressions that may only be used in a sentence whose main verb is negated. It was immediately realized that the context which permitted NPI's was much broader than simple occurrence in the scope of a negative. Although these constructions have been extensively studied in English, we are not aware of comparable studies in other languages. The surprisingly  diverse class of triggers has attracted much attention and many people have tried to suggest features that these contexts might have in common. What is of particular interest here, however, is that the same class of triggers figures in a totally unrelated Romance syntactic phenomenon: that is, the subjunctive mood is governed in those languages by many of the same verbs, adjectives and syntactic constructions which in English trigger NPI's In the remainder of this paper we will consider the category of triggers which function both for NPI's, at least in English, and for the subjunctive in a variety of Romance languages.

The completely fortuitous discovery that many Arabists assume that the Arabic verb TARABA, 'to sing, to entertain by singing' is the word from which troubadour comes would be a startling one to most Romance linguists. The mystery to be further explored here is the fairly simple fact that a relatively viable Arabic etymon for a word in Romance was not only never identified by Romance scholars desperately in search of a plausible etymon for an important word, but even after the etymon was suggested by an Arabist, it was almost completely ignored, despite the fact that the only Romance solutions were, to say the least, suspect. Further consideration, however, would indicate that this and other specific etymological problems are symptomatic, and that the real problem is the intellectual framework and set of scholarly assumptions and procedures which led to the complete ignoring of this possible Arabic etymon. Of all the problems normally associated with doing the usually tedious work of etymology, particularly in the notoriously well-documented case of the Romance languages, one that is very rarely discussed is that of the scholars' bias. Neverthless, the problem of the scholarly biases, prejudices in the etymological sense of the word, is a serious one in the field of Romance etymology, particularly where the word in question has a possible Arabic etymon.

My conclusion to these brief reflections on some aspects of Old French morpho(phono)logy must stress the 'orderly heterogeneity' I see in the latter. Phonological and morpholgical factors interact, the former, however, being subordinated, as suggested by the way the title is written.   I would like to propse that although no evalutation measure exists which would select the abstract or concrete version in the sense of showing that one 'works' and the other does not, the two approaches are in an important way not equivalent. I would like to make the modest claim that the burden of proof should rest on defenders of an abstract solution, since the latter 'includes' the concrete analysis plus something else. In other words, concrete observation contributes the first layer of an abstract analysis, the layer with which a 'concrete solution' essentially stops. The additional, second layer, of abstraction has to be justified. That is not to say that it could not, in some instances be motivated. The human language faculty is certainly capable of advanced degrees of abstraction. The issue remains, however, whether an abstracting capability needed for lengthy phonological derivations from underlying to surface representation operates in morpho(phono)logy or whether a taxonomic systematizing ability, no mean achievement, in fact, which would be required to process different types of rules and multiple rules, as discussed above, is in effect. Since the latter capacity derives directly from concrete observation, which must be part of either approach, I would speak of the 'logical priority' of concreteness in morpho(phono)logy.

Nonetheless, we think that a well motivated activity of formalization could modify the field drastically, especially in the domain of syntax, if precise and extensive descriptions were available.

While Burzio and Jaeggli propose base-generated VS order for certain lexical classes of verbs in Italian and French, Suñer derives VS order form underlying SVO for Spanish. In Spanish, more of the discussion has centered on the alternation between presentationals, characterized by VS order, and declarative, which are characterized by SV(O) order. This paper will argue against SVO as the only basic word order for Spanish. The pragmatically motived SV/VS alternation is far more prevalent than is generally realized. Furthermore, in a number of constructions VS order is strongly preferred or has become grammaticalized. Diachronic considerations will provide further evidence against an SVO analysis.

F3WSBIXS,journalArticle,1984,"Suñer, Margarita","Suñer, Margarita",,,,,,Controlled pro,Controlled Pro,"Of late, much energy in linguistic research has been devoted to investigating the properties of gaps, on the assumption that the study of these empty categories would provide a 'window' through which to reach for the principles of universal grammar. Within Government and Binding theory (Chomsky 1981a, 1981b) the Extended Projection Principle, which mandates that the θ positions required by lexical items must be represented at each syntactic level (D-structure, S-structure, and LF), and which further specifies that clauses have subjects, exhaustively determines the positions in which empty categories appear. The general premise is that 'missing' elements parallel the behavior of overt elements, their differences falling out from GB-theory. This paper is a constribution to the better understanding of the ec's PRO and pro. PRO has the features [+ pronominal + anaphor], and pro is [+ pronominal - anaphor]. My leading hypothesis is that the only difference between these two types of ec's is precisely a consequence of principles A and B of Binding theory. In other words, this difference is due to the fact that while PRO is always ungoverned because of the contradiction that obtains between principles A and B,  pro is the pronominal ec which appears in governed positions. Contrary to what Chomsky (1981a) states, in all other aspects these two types of ec's should behave alike. In this paper, I concentrate on the interaction of PRO and pro  with the theory of Control, leaving other similarites in their behavior for future research.

These studies base their discussion mostly on made-up sentences and contexts which are sometimes debatable but which are nevertheless called upon to offer evidence in support of certain subtle analytical differences. The present study, on the other hand, investigates the issue of aspectual meaning differences within the framework of a speech event, namely oral narrative. This approach permits us to test the hypotheses proposed by previous studies in a situation in which the speakers are making use of thier knowledge of the language. The main thesis of this paper is that verbal forms in isolation, or decontextualized, do not have specific meanings. Rather, each verbal form has a general referential meaning which determines its possible patterns of co-occurence with other forms and its use within a given communicative situation. The general referential meaning of a form may in part overlap with the meaning of another. It is only in the context of a speech event that form-specific meanings become evident, blocking the possibility of substituting a form while at the same time retaining the speaker's communicative intent.",,Papers from the XIIth Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1984012735&site=ehost-live,1984,10/31/19 19:31,10/31/19 19:31,229-251,229,251,22,"xii, 611",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 26,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,0,<p>Accession Number: 1984012735.

The Subjacency Constraint, said to be a universal principle regulating this relation, is formulated as follows: No rule can involve both X and Y in the configuration [...X...[m...[n...Y...]...]...X...] where both m and n are bounding nodes, i.e. nodes across which two elements cannot be related. the bounding nodes for English are said to be S̅, S and NP. For Spanish only S̅ and NP are generally considered to be bounding nodes. This has the effect in Spanish of permitting certain long-distance extractions which would not otherwise be allowed. Thus we see certain sentences are grammatical while others with a similar structure are ungrammatical as a result of a missing pronoun from the lower clause. The strategy of employing this resumptive pronoun, including a description of those contexts in which it may appear, in which it must appear, and in which it cannot appear, will be addressed in this paper. After a short section devoted to motivating the exclusion of S as a bounding node for Spanish, I will sketch in section 3 the contexts in which the resumptive pronoun appears in embedded questions. In section 4 I offer an explanation for these cases based on a structural analysis, relating the resumptive pronoun strategy to a constraint in Spanish against intersecting dependencies of Wh-elements and the variable they bind at S-structure.

Because the second person (and incidentally the first) showed a greater referential scope than did the third, a question is raised as to whether that greater scope might not be simply due to its pragmatic introduction in speech. Evidence was therefore sought that would help determine whether vous in the context discussed is pragmatically/diectically introduced or coreferentially determined. The facts support the latter rather than the former. Finally, it is pointed out that in actual compostion the second (or first) person rather than the third might be preferable, as it enables the writer to avoid ambiguity.

It will be evident that such a characterization will necessarily involve defining the nature of the modification as a whole; that is, the nature of all its components-the determiner and the noun, as well as the modifier. Thus, rules of preposability based on the semantics of the past participle alone, or on its transformational or lexical sources are, in and of themselves, insufficient. They may be incorporated, however, into a broader account which recognizes the flou (or 'squishiness') of the phenomenon and which appeals to notional versions of adjectival modification. Further, in order to accommodate instances of stylistic variablity characteristic of the phenomenon, an informal model of prototypical prenominal past participle modification will be proposed. The model will incorporate the notion of the appositional function of prenominal participal modifiers, and will elaborate the restrictions on the types of nouns and participles which may enter the modification paradigm.

Two prepositions which underwent considerable expansion were ad and de. One aspect of their expansion saw them vie with one another to introduce nominal complements expressing the idea of possession. This rivalry developed in Vulgar Latin and is still extant today in informal, popular, or regional varieties of French on both sides of the Atlantic. This long-standing case of variation has been commented upon by many linguists, yet certain aspects of its history and synchrony remain unclear. An initial goal of our study is to retrace the history of possessive à and de's protracted rivalry. This will take us from possessive à and de's origins in Vulgar Latin to the 17th century when à was proscribed by the French grammarians. From there we will move on to contemporary French and the other goal of our study, which is to see how possessive à is faring in nonstandard varieties of French in general and in informal Ontarian French in particular.

VKLWF3RP,journalArticle,1984,"Allen, Andrew S.","Allen, Andrew S.",,,,,,French Reduplication Limits the Arbitrariness of the Sign,French Reduplication Limits The Arbitrariness Of The Sign,"French reduplicated words are not randomly distributed throughout the lexicon, as they would be if the sign, or meaning-reference relationship, of a word were completely arbritrary. On the contrary, reduplications fall into a few related semantic categories. Reduplications are often onomatopoeic, diminutive and thus affectionate or pejorative, and sometimes characteristic of baby talk. Since reduplications are typically found in familiar and popular language and in baby talk, it is not surprising that the meanings are appropriate to contexts that lend themselves to such registers of speech. A common semantic feature for all reduplications is [+affect], since the affectionate diminutive nicknames, the pejorative adjectives like zinzin 'bizarre' and foufou 'foolish', and the familiar, popular and baby-talk words all express emotion. Reduplication thus conveys a certain attitude towards the referent, and this attitude helps select what the referents may be (Morin 1972:97). Resistance to phonological change also provides evidence that speakers recognize the link between form and meaning. Furthermore, other languages, exemplified by English oink-oink and boo-boo, suggest universal correlations between lexical reduplication and meaning. Finally, this discussion of one part of the French lexicon has stimulated a critical examination of usage labels in the dictionary. Thus, the hypothesis of limits to the arbitrariness of the sign proves useful for other tasks besides the explanation of French reduplications.

Section 1.1 is devoted to the identification of the constructions at issue and of their basic structures; section 1.2 presents and then refutes an alternative proposal which would analyze the overt subjects in (1) and (2) as dislocated NPs. We will attempt to demonstrate that there really is Nominative marking in the subject position of these clauses. Section 2 develops the theoretical core of the analysis.

GGCAF663,journalArticle,1985,"Tranel, Bernard","Tranel, Bernard",,,,,,On Closed Syllable Adjustment in French,On Closed Syllable Adjustment In French,"Closed syllable adjustment (CSA) broadly refers to a phonological process commonly assumed to account for the ə/ɛ and e/ɛ alternations of Modern French. In his seminal study of CSA, Dell (1973b/1980: Chapter 5) spelled out in detail the various conditions under which /ə/ and /e/ are changed to /ɛ/, but without trying to reduce and unify them. Dell's analysis was couched within the framework of linear phonology; since then, the theoretical status granted to metrical structures such as the syllable and the foot has given rise to several proposals for unifying the phonological treatment of CSA. In parallel, however, other analyses have suggested that the alternations commonly subsumed under CSA are not of a unified nature, and that at least some of them ought to be characterized lexically or morphophonologically rather than phonologically. The questions raised by CSA echo familiar issues in generative phonology, most fundamentally the abstractness/concreteness debate, the role of metrical structure in phonology, and the interaction of phonology and morphology. In this paper, I critically examine linear and metrical phonological treatments of CSA and identify some of their questionable internal characteristics and defective predictive powers. I propose and justify a split (phonological/morphological) analysis of CSA which gains from the integration of the syllable into phonological theory and from the results of a principled concrete approach to French phonology and morphology.

This paper does not exhaust the topic either. I will, however, try to say something decisive about relativization in spoken Brazilian Portuguese. The current paper is only a small part of a much larger study on relativization strategies in spoken Brazilian Portuguese, i.e., a study in which I describe and analyze the various factors that favor or inhibit the retention of the WH-phrase in the gap of the relative clauses. Non WH-phrases in Brazilian Portuguese, however, can also be either retained (pronominal anaphora) or deleted (zero anaphora) in main and in other subordinate-type clauses, i.e., the behavior of non WH-phrases in speech is also a variable process whose nature is, at least on the surface, similar to the variable gap in relatives. Also, considering that relative clauses have the basic function of relating a coreferential NP in the adjectival clause to an NP head in the matrix, and that as such, they perform the same functions as pre- or postnominal adjectives and postnominal modifiers, it became clear that the description and explanation of the relativization strategies in Brazilian Portuguese would gain in power and elegance if a parallel analysis of pronominalization strategies were simultaneously carried out.

It turns out that what could be assumed to be counterexamples instead provide striking confirmation of such an hypothesis because the obligatoriness of the preposition copying rule in FRs is only a strategy to comply with the fact that the content of pro must be determined. On the other hand, the optional character of preposition copying in relatives with a lexical head follows from the redundancy obtained when the head and the WH-phrase agree in Case. This *inverse attraction* phenomenon is not exclusive to Spanish but was shown to exist in Greek and Latin, where the process was also optional and was considered stylistic in nature. The moral of the story is that unalayzed data cannot disprove a given hypothesis, but rather only a principled analysis of such data can preform this task.

CQS9FJ8K,journalArticle,1985,"Piera, Carlos","Piera, Carlos",,,,,,On the Representation of Higher Order Complex Words,On The Representation Of Higher Order Complex Words,"This paper is primarily concerned with the theoretical implications of what have been called portmanteau words (Hockett, 1947). These are words, such as French au 'to the' and du 'of the', which are unanalyzable into a linear sequence of independent word-level components, but replace, and correspond to, one such sequence (French *à le, *de le). Assuming that portmanteau words are formed as a unit in the lexicon appears to pose a problem for standard theories of constituent structure, both inside the lexicon and in phrase-markers. A second topic of this paper is the viability of certain very strong constraints imposed on allomorphy by the theory of lexical phonology, as well as by other restrictive theories of phonology. These constraints require, in my view, that forms like du and au, but also others apparently less idiosyncratic, be formed in the lexicon. A solution to the difficulties alluded to in the preceding paragraph implies that, over the range of data considered here, those constraints can be imposed. The entire discussion will be framed here in terms of lexical phonology, but the two topics are conceptually and empirically distinct. On the one hand, irregular complex words will occur as such at some level regardless of where they are formed. On the other, it need not be the case that all apparent exceptions to the constraints of lexical phonology require the same kind of treatment, and indeed I claim in section 3 that they do not. These and other reasons indicate that it might have been wiser to treat the two topics seperately, but the second topic cannot be treated apart from the first, which it is the first that provides the empirical material for the second. I trust that no confusion will arise from my presenting both of them simultaneously.

In this theory it is assumed that a syllable is composed of three tiers. One of these tiers is considered a primary universal syllabic core that is normally accompanied by language-specific positive and negative conditions that allow or disallow regular or irregular constituents. Once these levels are fully analyzed, we are then in the position to know automatically how syllabic boundaries obtain in Spanish. This essay consists of three sections. In Section 2 we review the history of various studies of the syllable in Spanish. Section 3 introduces the structure of the syllable.

The evidence to support this claim comes from three sources. One is that switching subjects between L's with different features of INFL is constrained in predictable ways. I demonstrate this with the pro-drop parameter which determines subject switching between Spanish and English. Next, I show that the notion matrix L as determined by INFL explains how switching subjects in languages with different case-marking is predictably constrained.

Z9HPT7VZ,journalArticle,1985,"Hendrick, Randall","Hendrick, Randall",,,,,,The Distribution of the French Clitic en and the ECP,The Distribution Of The French Clitic En And The Ecp,"En is a clitic in French that corresponds either to a postverbal quantified phrase, an indefinite plural phrase, a partitive phrase, or a genitive phrase. The distribution of en exhibits two fundamental generalizations for which I will provide a unified explanation in this essay. First, when en does not originate as a direct object, it may correspond to the subject of only a small class of verbs including sembler and être. However, when en does correspond to a subject, it only does so as a genitive phrase and marginally, as a partitive phrase. It does not correspond to either a quantified phrase or an indefinite plural phrase. The second major generalization about the distribution of en that I am concerned with involves the interaction of the rule that cliticizes en (En Placement) with the rule of Raising to Subject. If en corresponds to a subject that has undergone Raising to Subject, it must appear cliticized to the infinitive of the clause in which the subject originated at deep structure. This essay develops a unified explanation for the two generalizations outlined above in terms of the Goverment Theory (GB theory) outlined in Chomsky (1981) and related work. The success of GB theory in providing such a unified explanation suggests strongly that its fundamental theoretical orientation is on the right track. The discussion that follows is organized in the following way. In Section 2, I argue that the interaction of EN Placement and Subject Raising is a consequence of the Empty Category Principle (ECP). Then in section 3, I show that the asymmetry with respect to En Placement between quantified, indefinite, partitive, and genitive phrases when in subject position also follows from the ECP.",,"Selected Papers from the XIIIth Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Chapel Hill, N.C., 24-26 March 1983",,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1985011251&site=ehost-live,1985,10/31/19 19:19,10/31/19 19:23,163-186,163,186,23,440,,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 36,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,5,<p>Accession Number: 1985011251.

I will give a brief summary of certain points of that paper as a way of introducting the data and the theoretical concerns we are about to delve into. It has been well established elsewhere that point-of-articulation and other types of assimilation phenomena are properly characterized as autosegmental relinking rules. The habanero liquid assimilations are thus produced by rules that create representations to which the application of further rules is goverened by the Rule Application Convention. This fact provides us with the basis for a principled explanation of a number of initially quite bizarre and puzzling phenomena. The Rule Application Convention makes crucial reference to the notion of linked (including merged) matrices, a notion that is simply not available without reference to multitiered autosegmental representations. Therefore, the data we have examined provide interesting empirical support for the Rule Application Convention in particular and for the theoretical constructs of autosegmental phonology in general.

Such is apparently the case of [+Back], which is never disregarded by Hispanic listeners in the interpretation of English vowels. Other feature vowels, e.g., [+Low], [-Low], [-Round] and [-Back], can apparently be disregarded. I reported on an experiment which verified that American English [æ] and [ʌ] are ambiguous to the Spanish ear. I showed that the dialect spoken by a Hispanic listener apparently plays no role in resolving the phonological ambiguities posed by those English vowels. I suggested that listeners guide themselves by the frequency which the perceived word may have in Spanish. I proposed that the perception in some cases of [æ] as a hiatus is due to the fact that the sounds is a diphthong in Buffalo English--the dialect of the person providing the stimuli. I assumed that listeners perceived the second element of this diphthong as a vowel not a glide because there are no low glides in Spanish, and that in deciding that the first element is [e] and the second [a] they guided themselves by the n-ary values of the feature Low.

While the participle exists in nearly all the dialects of the Gascon speech area, with the exception of the Bordelais region and the valley of the Garonne once it leaves the mountains, it is in the Pyrenean regions of Bearn and Bigorre that the most elaborate system exists. Here the particle is a nearly obligatory constituent of tensed clauses. It is proclitic, attaching to the finite verbal element of the clause, along with the object pronoun clitics and the negative marker. Based primarily on field work done in the Pyrenees between 1980 and 1983, the present analysis will examine the pragmatic nature of the particle, demonstrate that it serves to lexicalize one dimension of illocutionary force in Gascon, and, finally, suggest that the sentence particle should properly be treated as a constituent of the Gascon AUX.",,"Selected Papers from the XIIIth Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Chapel Hill, N.C., 24-26 March 1983",,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1985011246&site=ehost-live,1985,10/31/19 19:19,10/31/19 19:23,77-97,77,97,20,440,,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 36,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,15,<p>Accession Number: 1985011246.

First, we will briefly characterize the construction, distinguishing it from other construction that may superficially resemble it. Second, we show that Huang's analysis for Chinese is basically correct for the corresponding facts of EP. Specifically, we show that there is a lexically unrealized structural position in the grammatical representation of null object sentences and that, furthermore, this position is an empty category of the type variable, that is, locally bound to an A'-position. Third, we argue that this variable is best characterized as a trace left by application of Move α in the syntactic component of the grammar, since constructions with a null object obey island condition and are subject to principles statable at the level of S-structure. Fourth, we suggest that a rule of Predication of the type proposed by Chomsky (1977, 1982) for relative clauses is responsible for the interpretation of null object clauses. We also speculate as to the nature of the parameter that separates languages like Chinese and Portuguese, on the one hand, from languages like Spanish, French, and English, on the other hand, which do not have null objects. Departing here from Huang's proposals, we claim that the relevant parameter is whether or not the rule of Predication is open to pragmatics. Fifth and finally, we try to derive the properties of the null object from the interaction of the suggested parameter with three sub-theories of the grammar: Government theory, Binding theory and Q-theory.

Indeed, our main concern here is to describe a situation of pronominal tension in Brazilian Portuguese (BP), as it is spoken in urban Sao Paulo. Nevertheless, we have a major theoretical claim to make: the analysis of simultaneous situations of tension in different, yet related, parts of the grammar may shed light upon how the linguistic system undergoing change in some of its parts, will eventually 'shape up': and furthermore, on the basis of this kind of speculation, we argue that predictions can be made for different languages which present tension in the same parts of the grammar, even when the direction of the linguistic change is not altogether the same. Therefore, our ultimate goal is to demonstrate that one single linguistic change may cause a major restructuring of the entire grammar, and that only through careful and detailed descriptive work can we reach a level of analytical adequacy in order to draw meaningful theoretical implications from the data. Thus to return to the first sentence of this third paragraph: although this paper might seem, at first glance, merely descriptive as well as language specific, it is de facto intended to be theroetically as well as typologically oriented. Two different, yet related, grammatical rules, currently undergoing change in BP, will be focussed upon here. In the foreground we will be looking at the situation of pronominal tension in BP: in the background we will be referring to the relativization system in BP.",,Studies in Romance Linguistics,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1986011276&site=ehost-live,1986,11/1/19 17:39,11/1/19 17:39,343-358,343,358,15,"xiv, 452",,,397020,Pubs. in Lang.

The recognition of the existence of lexical null segments in Romance is best accomplished within a framework that uses multitiered syllable representations. The interplay between null and epenthetic segments, if it is perceived from the right perspective, goes a long way towards shaping the phonological component of a language. In terms of synchronic description, null segments represent an unstable, possibly transitional, state of affairs.

Here we start by asking whether Evans meant 'referential' and 'bound' to be inrinsic properties of pronouns (probably not), or whether 'kind' is simply shorthand for 'analysis' (or 'interpretation'): that is, given a pronoun P in a structure S, P can be analyzed (= interpreted) as either referential or bound depending on P's relative position in S (relative, say to other NPs in S). This will lead us into a discussion of the intrinsic and structural properties not only of pronouns (overt and empty), but also of anaphors and R expressions, the other two categories that enter the Binding Conditions.

I refer to these observations, however, and what they imply, to illustrate more general regularities, and among other things to argue that a better understanding of these regularities can be expected to the extent that analyses are based on the assumption that factors of different kinds necessarily are involved in language at all times, constraining it in different ways. The facts at issue here, however, recommend bearing in mind too the potential role of language external factors of different kinds: at the very least, those based on (1) physiological and psychological propensities of the language user, which I refer to as 'speaker-based'; and those based on (2) the kinds of uses to which (the) language is likely to be put (both in general and in particular socio-cultural contexts), which I call 'reference-based'.

The terms 'popular,' 'learned,' and 'semilearned' have been applied, respectively, to words that obey all, nearly none, or only some of the presumed rules of change. With particular reference to the set of words labeled 'semilearned' in Spanish, I will describe a phenomenon that I have found corresponds to many of these words, namely their violation of one and only one sound rule. Often this evasion of a single rule alone can set a word on a radically different path from its real or imagined regular counterpart, thus obscuring the simplicity of the original deviation. In seeking to explain these single-rule exceptions, I will suggest that the traditional appeal to learned influence - although credible in some cases - has often been made by reasoning or speculating backwards form the irregular form of a word, without corroborating evidence about the cause. As an alternative, I will suggest that William Wang's (1969) hypothesis of lexical diffusion offers an explanation on logically safer ground, as far as it goes.

She also claims that this supports Rizzi's (1978) approach to boundedness where bounding nodes are parameterized. I will show that her arguments against a ""no successive cyclicity"" analysis can be overcome by making a technical change in Kayne's version of such an analysis. This revised version will be shown to be conceptually at least as valid as the most widely accepted version of the successive cyclicity analysis which incorporates Chomsky's (1973) basic idea and Rizzi's idea of parameterized bounding nodes, and empirically superior to it.

AF9EEVP7,journalArticle,1987,"Wetzels, Leo","Wetzels, Leo",,,,,,The Timing of Latent Consonants in Modern French,The Timing Of Latent Consonants In Modern French,"Recent research into the structure of phonological representations has led to the recognition of a timing tier containing timing units that, in the unmarked case, relate to the segmental matrices in a one-to-one fashion. The representation of the timing units on a separate tier suggests that it might be interesting to explore the descriptive advantages of having timing units with no corresponding segment (empty slots) and, conversely, segments without a corresponding timing unit (floating segments). In this study, French liaison will be looked upon as a process of phonological timing through which underlying floating segments are assigned a timing slot by rule. While preserving the advantages of earlier non-linear approaches to liaison, our account will be able to express generalizations and make predictions which the previous attempts were unable to achieve. In particular, it will be shown that, with respect to the rules of (re)syllabification, latent consonants manifesting themselves at the phonetic surface behave in no respect differently from those consonants which are always pronounced. From this observation it follows that the domain of realization of floating consonants must for all languages be smaller - as in Modern French - or at the most coextensive with the domain of (re)syllabification. It also becomes possible to assign theoretical status to the observation that liaison consonants in French, whether timed in the lexicon or at the level of the sentence phonology, are dentals in the unmarked case. Finally, the analysis presented here leads to a theoretical reinterpretation of the so called 'h-aspiré' words, whose phonological behaviour will be described by way of a diacritic feature located at the level of the syllable tier.

It is the purpose of this article to fill this gap. In Italian and French, a past participle not only agrees with its subject ""across"" an essere-type auxiliary; it also may agree with a clitic object pronoun across an avere-type auxiliary. This type of agreement is impossible in Spanish, Portuguese and Romanian, although in these languages too, a participle agrees with subject across an Essere-auxiliary. Since the distribution of clitic/participle agreement therefore is co-extensive with the distribution of auxiliary alternation across the Romance languages, it seems reasonable to conjecture that the same parameter governs the distribution of both phenomena. In the following sections, I will attempt to show that starting out from this conjecture, one is indeed led to a parametrized principle that both explains extension of clitic/participle agreement and sheds new light on the nature of the auxiliary alternation and its distribution in Romance.

This paper reports some of our findings with regard to variations with grade and sex. One might expect, given the model above, that the overall incidence of cohesion would increase with age, as children become more aware of using cohesion to clue the reader. However, it is also possible that cohesion would decrease as writers become more aware of their own and their readers' ability to deal with inexplicit elements or links which require inferences. Yet another possibility is that both are true but cancel out each other's effecs. If this is the case, then the overall amount of cohesion should not change with age. More specifically, we expected that young children's reliance on conjunctions and lexical repetition would give way to more parsimonious use of conjunctions and greater use of referential cohesion (especially anaphora) to take place of repetition. In the case of Portuguese, we expected that the ellipsis so common in spoken Portuguese would give way to more explicit text using less ellipsis.

The language under study is mainly European Portuguese, but we believe that the conclusions arrived at here carry over in general to the other languages of the Romance family. The infinitival form of a verb in Romance is morphologically marked with a suffix which we will represent as -r, its most common form in the Romance family. One of the conclusions of the present paper is that this morpheme is the source of important properties displayed by infinitival clauses in Romance. In section 1, we show that infinitival clauses have nominal properties, which they share with common NP's. This makes Case theory relevant for infinitival clauses as well as for NPs. In section 2, we provide an analysis of the morpheme -r as the source of these nominal properties. In section 3, we show how a contrast between European Portuguese and French concerning infinitival clauses in extraposed position may be accounted for on the basis of the analysis presented in sections 1 and 2, given that European Portuguese, but not French, is a null subject language.",,Studies in Romance Languages,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1987011724&site=ehost-live,1987,11/1/19 17:46,11/1/19 17:46,237-249,237,249,12,"x, 325",,,397020,Pubs. in Lang.

Finally, some authors have dealt with the nature of liaison consonants and their status in phonological representations. To these three issues, nasalisation can be added as a related problem. In what follows we will be concerned mainly with the second and third problems. The analysis presented here follows that of Vergnaud (1982).

The general framework is Chomsky (1982). The crucial notions of θ-positions and chains will be defined in exactly the same way as in Chomsky (1982). The only essential difference is connected with the theory of Binding: although Principles A and B are accepted, Principle C is rejected. It is to some extent replaced by an autonomous Principle of Disjoint Reference, which of course does not say anything about binding, but belongs to the interpretive component (LF, according to Chomsky's terminology). Free indexing is accepted, but the relationship between coindexation and coreference is understood in a somewhat unusual way. The nature of the revision will appear in the paper. The main claim is the following: in order to explain the floating behavior of certain items, a new notion of chain is needed, which is analogous to the more classical notion, except that it attibutes interpretive properties, rather than structural properties. Thus, floating appears to be a particular case of a more general phenomenon. Indeed, it ceases to be connected in an essential way to quantification, so that the usual notion of ""floating quantifiers"" appears to be ill-formed.

In contrast, embedded indicative subjects are free to corefer to a matrix subject. Following Chomsky (1982), I assume that the nonovert pronominal subject of null subject languages is the empty category [pro]. As a pronominal element, [pro] must be free in its governing category to satisfy Condition B of the binding theory. Then if the disjoint reference of (1a) is a binding theory effect, the governing category of the subjunctive subject must be the matrix clause rather than its own S.

Other letter doublings of the period have always been taken at face value. Why should f doublings be interpreted any differently from these other doublings? I will argue here that f doublings were also phonetically significant in the medieval period, although the data seem to be extremely confusing at first. This present study reexamines the single and double f alternations found in Documentos Lingüísticos, one of the largest anthologies of Spanish medieval documents (Menéndez Pidal 1919), and other doublings found in an unpublished 13th-c. manuscript (MS Edgerton 910, British Museum).

Thus, for example, as early as 1887, it was noted by Eduardo de la Barra that the expected paroxytonic stress of the word cóntra'against'is' intolerable'in the rhythmic context of the fourth line of the chorus of the Chilean national anthem and is therefore altered to oxytonic contré. That is, as shown in (1), stressing cóntra in the usual way would violate the anapestic trimeter which otherwise uniformly characterizes the verses under consideration, whereas the unusual stresspattern contrfi fits in perfectly with its metrical contextcontrast especially/tf\l así/lo cóntra/la'^ bpre8ión/'or the refuge from oppression'with/tf^ fel así/lo contré/la opresión/.",,Advances in Romance Linguistics,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1988010827&site=ehost-live,1988,11/1/19 18:00,11/1/19 18:02,151-170,151,170,19,"viii, 437",,,397020,Pubs. in Lang.

It will be argued that such restructured compounds are neither the output of a syntactic movement rule nor of a rebracketing rule, but are instead base generated synthetic verbal compounds. Extending Zubizaretta's (1985) analysis of Romance causatives, it will be proposed that restructuring verbs are syntactically ambiguous between functioning as lexical heads and as bound morphemes, even though the phonology uniformly treats them as discrete words. This allows us to treat the 'restruct-uring' operation as a subcase of verbal compounding. Some of the peculiar properties of restructured complexes will be traced to their morphological derivation; in particular, their variable auxiliary selection and their status as non-composite constituents with respect to syntactic movement rules.",,Advances in Romance Linguistics,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1988010820&site=ehost-live,1988,11/1/19 18:00,11/1/19 18:00,17-32,17,32,15,"viii, 437",,,397020,Pubs. in Lang.

As a consequence, a new theory of prodrop emerges. Old French (OF) of the 12th and 13th centuries presents a form of prodrop and inversion unlike that of the modern prodrop languages studied. The facts of OF, when analyzed within the theory of generative grammer, lead us to new insights into the relationship between prodrop and inversion. I will argue that the phenomenon of prodrop is not itself a parameter of universal grammer (UG) but reduces rather to directional government and rich agreement. This approach helps explain the distribution of pro across languages and within a given language, and it helps explain the change from a grammer which licenses pro to one which does not.",,Advances in Romance Linguistics,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1988010819&site=ehost-live,1988,11/1/19 18:00,11/1/19 18:01,1-16,1,16,15,"viii, 437",,,397020,Pubs. in Lang.

I attribute the distinction to a unitary factor: a mechanism of morphological agreement shared by languages of the Balkan peninsula, and missing in the Romance family, with the exception of Rumanian. From a formal perspective, I adopt the theory of barriers (Chomsky 1986b) allowing maximal projections to be transparent to external government when they bear an appropriate relation with a c-commanding lexical head. I show that the subject position [NP, IP (= S)] of a subjunctive complement is accessible to government from without the clause, across a S'-S (= CP-IP) structure. On the other hand, positions within the VP, such as [NP, VP], are opaque to this type of external government.

It has long been recognized that Classical Latin is basically verb-final, not as a syntactic absolute but too strongly to be classified as a mere tendency. The facts of Latin morphosyntax fall into line with the traits Greenberg claimed normally accompany OV languages, 1 though mostly in a trivial way: Latin fails to violate Greenberg's syntactic strictures by virtue of its free word order. However, it does accord positively with Universal 41 (Greenberg 1966: 96):"" If in a language the verb follows both the nominal subject and nominal object as the dominant order, the language almost always has a case system.""

These principles, in general, establish correlations among thematic roles ('meaning'in an intuitive sense), syntactic categories (canonical struc tural realizations) and/or specific syntactic positions (cf.

We will assume, following Plann (1981), that infinitives fall into two groups -- nominal and sentential. The infinitives that occur without the article el (or other determiners) shown in (1) are sentential and those in (2) are nominal. This has been shown conclusively in Plann (1981) and we will not justify such a grouping here. The evidence, of course, comes from their distribution. Contexts shown in (2d) and (2e) (subject position of a VSO sentence and embedded subject position) are contexts where NP's but not clauses, are known to occur, and the infinitives in (1) cannot occur in such contexts. We will henceforth call nominal infinitives DP (Determiner Phrase) infinitives, following recent terminology (Abney 1987, Kuroda 1986) and call sentential infinitives CP (Comp Phrase) infinitives (Chomsky 1986). We shall argue that a lexical subject is licensed in CP infinitives if the nonfinite I (NFL) (with AGR -- we assume à la Chomsky 1989 and Pollock 1989 that even nonfinite clauses have AGR) moves to the head C position of CP and is consequently governed and Case-assigned by an external governor, following essentially Raposo (1987) and Suñer (1987).",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.69.25yoo,New Analyses in Romance Linguistics,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1991011463&site=ehost-live,1991,11/1/19 18:16,11/1/19 18:20,353-370,353,370,17,406,,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 69,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,27,"<p>Accession Number: 1991011463.

However, items in the embedded VP in (1), such as NP2, are opaque to the same external relation. I label the situation depicted in (1) Balkan transparency, and summarize the formal system behind it in 1.2-1.3.

Leo",,,,,,Contrastive and Allophonic Properties of Brazilian Portuguese Vowels,Contrastive And Allophonic Properties Of Brazilian Portuguese Vowels,"In this paper we aim at providing a better understanding of a number of phonological aspects of Brazilian Portuguese (henceforth BP) by placing them in a cross-linguistic perspective. One issue to be dealt with concerns the asymmetry between the accented (seven) vowel system and the unaccented (five) vowel system. One way of approaching this distribution is to consider the [ATR] opposition contrastive in stressed syllables only. This makes it possible to compare BP-—and many other Romance dialects——to languages like Guarani, where the nasal contrast on vowels is limited to stress positions, or to tone languages, where underlying tone contrast typically occurs in stressed syllables. A principled account of these and similar facts will have to explain why a surplus of vocalic contrast can only be found in stressed vowels. Also, an analysis will be given of the various manifestations of nasality before oral consonants. It will be argued that BP nasal consonants, if they occur in coda position, are incomplete segments, lacking a place node in the underlying representation. We will also deal with the assimilatory behaviour of nasal consonants, which may adopt the place features of a following stop, but not of a following fricative. A proposal will be put forward with regard to the location of the feature [continuant] in the feature geometry, which severely limits the class of possible assimilation rules and which, moreover, can explain why in BP regressive place assimilation for nasals is confined to nasal-stop sequences.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.69.10wet,New Analyses in Romance Linguistics,,,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1991011449&site=ehost-live,1991,11/1/19 18:16,11/1/19 18:18,77-99,77,99,22,406,,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 69,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,35,"<p>Accession Number: 1991011449.

We support our claim with French Stylistic Inversion data (cf. Kayne & Pollock 1978, Kayne 1986, Pollock 1986, Deprez 1988a, 1988b). In a nutshell, the basic facts are that direct object NPs do not co-occur with Stylistic Inversion constructions, while WH-traces do. Our analysis will rely on the following premises: (i) contrary to what is proposed by Kayne & Pollock (1978), Kayne (1986), and Pollock (1986), we agree with Deprez (1988) that Stylistic Inversion does not involve rightward movement of the subject NP, and that the subject NP remains in its base-generated VP-position (cf. Kitagawa 1986, Kuroda 1988, Koopman & Sportiche to appear) and that an empty pro is licensed in SpecIP; (ii) strict adjacency must be observed for structural accusative case to be assigned (see Stowell 1981); this adjacency follows from an extension of Rizzi's Minimality Condition, in this case applied to governees instead of governors. Our Minimality Condition on Case Assignment, combined with the VP-internal subject analysis of Stylistic Inversion, will account for the asymmetry between object NPs and WH-traces, on the assumption that a direct object WH-phrase can get case in the VP-adjoined position, a process which is reminiscent of Kayne's (1984) case marking through COMP (cf. Chomsky 1986a, for WH-movement through the VP-adjoined position).",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.91.20val,Romance Languages and Modern Linguistic Theory,978-90-272-3591-6 (Eur.),,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1993011333&site=ehost-live,1992,10/1/19 20:45,10/1/19 20:45,325-338,325,338,13,,,"viii, 416 pp.",,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: Current Issues in Linguistic Theory: 91,Benjamins,Amsterdam,,mzh,EBSCOhost,51,"<p>Accession Number: 1993011333.

The specific interest of this case is that in a syntactic construction involving dislocation, syllabification properties of liaison allomorphs motivate a suppletive analysis for a subset of the adjectives often considered to warrant unique lexical representations. From a more general perspective, these results indicate that phonetic closeness between surface allomorphs may constitute deceiving evidence for the postulation of a unique lexical representation for a given alternating morpheme, even when the alternations can be related by means of natural phonological rules.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.91.18tra,Romance Languages and Modern Linguistic Theory,978-90-272-3591-6 (Eur.),,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1993011331&site=ehost-live,1992,10/1/19 20:45,10/1/19 20:46,269-308,269,308,39,,,"viii, 416 pp.",,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: Current Issues in Linguistic Theory: 91,Benjamins,Amsterdam,,mzh,EBSCOhost,57,"<p>Accession Number: 1993011331.

In both cases, I will show that the arguments invoked by Ruwet (1983) are largely independent of infinitival complementation.

H3IDSGR5,journalArticle,1993,"Winters, Margaret E.","Winters, Margaret E.",,,,,,On the Semantic Structure of the French Subjunctive,On The Semantic Structure Of The French Subjunctive,"In the present paper, I will suggest answers to these questions. It is accordingly divided into three parts, of which the first is a review of the entire semantic network of the subjunctive, as set forth in Winters (1991), and the relationship of each of its parts to the others. In the second section I will consider some proposals which may answer the question posed above about the relationship of prototype and schema, while in the third section I will briefly discuss the more general nature of grammatical categories. One striking feature of linguistic units of all sizes is that they are, most often, polysemous, with diverse meanings which cannot be related one to another by any finite list of necessary and sufficient features. Rather, they are arranged in an internally structured radial category (or set, cf. Lakoff 1987) in which some members better exemplify the set than others.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.103.27win,Linguistic Perspectives on the Romance Languages,,978-90-272-3605-0 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1993010126&site=ehost-live,1993,11/1/19 18:50,11/1/19 18:53,271-279,271,279,8,"xxii, 404",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 103,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,9,"<p>Accession Number: 1993010126.

More specifically, with respect to the domain of application of enclisis, it will be demonstrated that the domain which comprises the enclitic and its host cannot be Nespor and Vogel’s (1986) clitic group, but must rather be the Prosodic Word of Selkirk’s (1986) and Selkirk and Shen’s (1990) theory of prosodic structure. Furthermore, it will be shown that the evolution from enclisis to proclisis can be explained as a consequence of the restructuring of phonological domains, which will be formally described as a change in the edge-parameter setting for the construction of Prosodic Words. Finally, it will be demonstrated that enclisis should not be described in terms of a reapplication of the word-internal reduction and deletion rules of syncope (colaphum*[kolapu]>*[kolpu]‘blow with the fist’) and apocope (*[kolpu]>[kolp] colp), but rather as the independent application of a deletion rule which applies within the Prosodic Word and which has the effect of creating unmarked stressed feet.",,Linguistic Perspectives on the Romance Languages,,978-90-272-3605-0 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1993010117&site=ehost-live,1993,11/1/19 18:50,11/1/19 18:52,149-163,149,163,14,"xxii, 404",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 103,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,12,"<p>Accession Number: 1993010117.

It has been claimed that these similarities are the result of, among others, processes of transfer of features from one language into another, that is, processes that imply what Martinet (in his Preface to Weinreich’s Languages in Contact) calls “the permeability of linguistic cells”. The issue of the permeability of grammars to inﬂuence from a different grammatical system has been a core concern of sociolinguistics and historical linguistics, evident in the discussions of the role that external social forces (including as such a different language) and internal language factors may play in stimulating or constraining linguistic change.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.103.08sil,Linguistic Perspectives on the Romance Languages,,978-90-272-3605-0 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1993010110&site=ehost-live,1993,11/1/19 18:50,11/1/19 18:51,19-43,19,43,24,"xxii, 404",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 103,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,72,"<p>Accession Number: 1993010110.

In an analysis focusing on the evolution of the genitive, we propose that the JG in Old French has directly inherited the same structure in Latin, although Latin had no definite article. In later OF, when case endings ceased to be pronounced, case had to be checked by a preposition. At that point, children no longer had the morphological cues (Lightfoot D. The development of language: acquisition, change, and evolution. Blackwell, Oxford, 1999) to assign a genitive meaning to the possessor, the JG was lost. The reason for the narrowing of the à genitives can be explained by the fact that dative à has always been limited to persons (Herslund M. Problèmes de syntaxe de l’ancien français.

This evidence comes both from phonological processes of French referring to the PW, that is, glide formation (GF) and prefixal nasalization, and from cross-linguistic similarities to the PWs of Italian,Hungarian, and Korean. Moreover, the analysis demonstrates that the advantages of referring to the PW include an autonomy of phonology and morphology unavailable in a level-ordered framework, and the possibility made available by reference to prosodic structure of delaying rule application until the postlexical level. While the PW may be constructed in the lexicon, rules for which the PW is the domain of application may be withheld until later postlexical application. This account, following the lead of Inkelas (1989) and Booij and Lieber (1993), is in contrast to other recent analyses of GF and prefixal nasalization in the literature in which these phonological processes are unnecessarily constrained by morphological operations, namely prefixation and compounding.",,Contemporary Research in Romance Linguistics,,978-90-272-3626-5 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1995075325&site=ehost-live,1995,11/1/19 18:57,11/1/19 18:58,13-24,13,24,11,381,,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 123,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,9,"<p>Accession Number: 1995075325.

I also propose that cases of 'no fault se' are possessive ethical dative constructions applicable to all ergatives except psych verbs (Class IV). To sum up, although Spanish is not a formally (morphological) ergative language like Basque or Georgian for example, it does show functional ergativity in Burzio's sense. In addition to furthering the work of earlier studies of ergativity in Romance (namely Burzio) the contributions of this paper have been threefold: (1) to distinguish middle voice se from passive se by means of Ergative se, dispelling the misconception that the two are really one construct; (2) to reveal cases of 'no fault se' as possessive ethical datives which apply to all ergative verbs except psych verbs; (3) and to offer for the first time a typology of the five distinct ergative forms in which a Spanish verb can manifest itself, unifying middle voice, inherent se, and 'no fault' under one analysis.

R9GF859M,journalArticle,1994,"Rooryck, Johan","Rooryck, Johan",,,,,,Against Optional Movement for Clitic Climbing,Against Optional Movement For Clitic Climbing,"Clitic climbing has received a great deal of attention in recent years. These constructions are not only revealing of the relations between matrix verbs and embedded complements (Rizzi 1982, Burzio 1986, Rosen 1989), but they also allow for an inquiry into the types of head movement (incorporation of clitics vs. incorporation into functional categories, Kayne 1989, Roberts 1991).Mazzola, M. L. (1994). In this paper, two arguments will be developed to show that a minimalist account of clitic climbing along the lines just sketched is possible and desirable. The first argument comes from a surprising contrast in clitic climbing out of Italian and Spanish Wh infinitives. Kayne's (1989, 1991) cl T° movement analysis predicts that the matrix and embedded verbs will constitute a single temporal domain in all cases of clitic climbing. The second argument is based on the fact that non Wh clitic climbing constructions do constitute a single temporal domain with the embedded clause.",,Issues and Theory in Romance Linguistics,,978-0-87840-243-4,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1994014612&site=ehost-live,1994,11/1/19 19:08,11/1/19 19:08,417-443,417,443,26,"xiii, 546",,,,,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,0,"<p>Accession Number: 1994014612.

5X8RBLKW,journalArticle,1994,"Parodi, Claudia","Parodi, Claudia",,,,,,On Case and Agreement in Spanish and English DPs,On Case And Agreement In Spanish And English Dps,"In this paper, I propose a model of Determiner Phrases (henceforth referred to as DPs) that mirrors to a great extent the structure of sentences. I assume that the arguments of DPs are projected in the same fashion as the arguments of VPs and other lexical categories. Following Larson (1988) and Sportiche (1990), I suggest that DPs, like in sentences, project a shelled structure with several levels of complementation and iterated raising of the head. The number of levels projected in a particular structure will depend on the number of arguments and modifiers licensed by the head. In this model, the arguments in DPs and VPs are projected in the same positions in English and Spanish. The differences between these two languages would be reduced to morphological dissimilarities, which determine the extent to which the arguments of DPs will move before spell out applies. The theoretical background that I assume for Agreement is Chomsky (1992). Within this framework, Agreement in sentences and DPs is a local relation which takes place in the checking domain of . The checking domain of is the Minimal residue of , which includes its Spec position and anything adjoined to its head or its Spec. Lexical elements with all their morphological features, including Case and phi features, are drawn from the lexicon. These must be checked for Case and Agreement in the appropriate positions. At any point of the derivation the spell out operation (which switches to the PF component) may be applied.

These facts are approached in a framework in which ARB SE occupies a (sublexical) AGR 1 position and must 'absorb' structural Case. The prediction is that ARB SE will only appear in those non finite contexts in which it can satisfy its Case requirements in an AGR head. This paper is organized as follows. Section 1 presents an analysis of the clitic ARB SE as an agreement morpheme in an AGR head. We look at the Spanish data together with the hypothesis to be tested. In section 2 we focus on control structures, comparing Spanish and Italian with European Portuguese (EP). Section 3 deals with raising structures; a 'double' analysis of parecer 'to seem' (i) as a raising V and (ii) as a V triggering Aux to Comp is suggested to account for the data.

The availability of this movement operation in French has been attributed to principles of Theta theory (see Pollock 1989 and others).

In this respect both German and Spanish may be considered Verb Second (V2) languages. We will show, however, that in spite of these similarities, there are some aspects in which the two languages differ.

CDLJLIVN,journalArticle,1994,"Maier, Nicole","Maier, Nicole",,,,,,Causative Constructions in French and Portuguese,Causative Constructions In French And Portuguese,"Two phenomena which continue to pose interesting theoretical questions are clitic movement in causative constructions and the inflected infinitive in Portuguese. In this paper, I will present an analysis of inflected infinitives as complements to causative verbs which will explain the presence or absence of clitics and the conditions under which Agr in the inflected infinitive may assign nominative Case. However, before doing so, I will first present my analysis for the causative construction itself. In this paper, I have shown that causative verbs allow for verb incorporation of an embedded verb whenever the complement clause is a VP. When there is no incorporation, French and Portuguese differ with respect to the types of complement clause fazer and laisser subcategorize for in that French takes a TP and Portuguese allows for either an AgrP or a CP. Nevertheless, the two are similar in that causative verbs will subcategorize for the minimal maximal projection needed in order to not violate the Case Filter and the ECP. This was seen with the placement of clitics corresponding to the embedded subject as well as the object of the embedded verb. Finally, the occurrence of inflected infinitives in the complement clause prohibits the causative verb from assigning Case to the embedded subject and clitics corresponding to this position will never be realized on a functional category in the matrix clause. Whether or not Agr of the inflected infinitive needs to be governed by an external Case assignor poses no problems for this account of causative verbs in that I allow for the complement clause to be whatever minimal maximal projection is needed in order to satisfy the syntactic constraints of a particular dialect.",,Issues and Theory in Romance Linguistics,,978-0-87840-243-4,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1994014608&site=ehost-live,1994,11/1/19 19:08,11/1/19 19:10,355-365,355,365,10,"xiii, 546",,,,,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,1,"<p>Accession Number: 1994014608.

So, even though adjunction within DP is not restricted, we can still predict that expressions without a referential index (adjuncts) can never extract due to the limited governing capacities of nouns: nouns are inadequate governors for the traces of non subcategorized constituents. Furthermore, if this approach is on the right track, it has the advantage of not only dispensing argument movement from the antecedent government requirement (cf. see the extensive literature regarding the notion of antecedent government) but also of allowing independently motivated principles of grammar (the ECP, Binding Condition C—or the Theta Criterion (as stated in (21)) to derive the fact that both prenominal and postnominal arguments can block extraction.

EMG73N5E,journalArticle,1994,"Wind, Maarten de","Wind, Maarten de",,,,,,Against V-to-C in French Complex Inversion,Against V-to-c In French Complex Inversion,"The distinctive feature of French complex inversion is that the subject which is always lexical is accompanied by a weak subject pronoun following the inflected part of the verb. The distribution of the complex inversion is limited in that it is found exclusively in root clauses. The position of the lexical subject and the position of the inflected part of the verb on the one hand and the status of the subject clitic on the other have been the focus of attention in several analyses, cf. Kayne (1983), Rizzi & Roberts (1989), Drijkoningen (1990), Hulk (1992) and Roberts (1993). In the GB model in vogue at the beginning of the eighties, the generation of the complex inversion was problematic for the simple reason that the number of positions in the phrase structure did not equal the number of constituents. Kayne (1983) solved the problem by introducing the subject clitic in the Transformational Component; it was inserted in the SPEC IP after the lexical subject had been adjoined to the CP/S'. The introduction of the principle according to which all lexical material enters the structure at the D structure level had the effect that this analysis could not be maintained. (For a different view, see Chomsky (1992.) Since Sportiche (1988) it has been widely accepted that subjects are base generated in a specifier position in the VP. This allowed Rizzi & Roberts (1989) to solve Kayne's problem. The lexical subject was generated in the SPEC VP to the left of V, while the subject clitic was inserted in the SPEC IP. In accordance with Kayne's analysis, they proposed to move the lexical subject to the SPEC CP. This movement was actually superfluous, since Pollock (1989) introduced the ''Split IP,"" which means that the features of IP, Tense and Agreement, get their own projection. The following derivation became possible: in Pollock's structure, where TP is higher in the tree than AgrP, the subject moves to the SPEC TP while the clitic is generated within the SPEC AgrP. However, in this way sentences like (1) which are clearly interrogatives are, according to Rizzi & Roberts, assigned a syntactic structure which resembles too much that of a declarative. They argued that the fact that we are dealing with interrogatives should be reflected by the syntactic representation and therefore movement all the way up to C0 was preferred. With regards to the function of the subject clitic Kayne (1983) claimed that it prevents an ECP violation by the lexical subject which is unable to antecedent govern its trace in the SPEC IP. An imminent violation is avoided by using a ""deus ex machina"" device which is the introduction of the subject clitic. Rizzi & Roberts (1989) do not pay much attention to the function of the subject clitic. They only discuss the question why in French a lexical subject can occur with a subject pronoun and not in English. Roberts (1993) builds on Rizzi & Roberts (1989). There it is claimed that the function of the subject clitics is to prevent an ECP violation: the SPEC IP needs to be identified. One way of doing this is to let pass the lexical subject through the SPEC AgrsP on its way to the CP. The trace the subject leaves behind causes an ECP violation, since the configuration does not meet the proper head government requirement as formulated in Rizzi (1991) stating that a trace has to be governed by a head within its own projection. It follows that the SPEC AgrSP cannot be identified by the lexical subject. Therefore a clitic is introduced. The subject clitic incorporates at S structure from the SPEC AgrSP into the verb in C0. This process is meant to provide the clitic with a case feature necessary for reasons of PF visibility. However, Hulk (1992) points out that cliticization of the weak subject pronoun creates a trace which fails to be properly governed as well. We will develop an analysis which deals with this problem. We will proceed as follows: Section (1) will be devoted to the review of Rizzi & Roberts (1989) and Roberts (1993); and in section (2) we will present our account of the complex inversion. In section (3), finally, we will discuss complex inversion in Valdôtain, a Franco Provençal dialect.",,Issues and Theory in Romance Linguistics,,978-0-87840-243-4,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1994014603&site=ehost-live,1994,11/1/19 19:08,11/1/19 19:09,271-284,271,284,13,"xiii, 546",,,,,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,15,"<p>Accession Number: 1994014603.

Our findings support previous proposals that [Spec,IP] is an A' position in Spanish. In addition, they indicate the importance of agreement relationships in syntax.

Nevertheless, data from Spanish, Standard English and Appalachian English illustrate the importance of the relationship between the [Spec,IP] position in the embedded clause and the complementizer which governs it in terms of extraction possibilities. These facts can best be accounted for if we assume [Spec,IP] to be the landing site of wh phrases in Spanish, as proposed by Goodall (1991a,b), Arnaiz (1991), and Fontana (1992).

The existence of this level is based on a particular interpretation of the Minimalist Program outlined in Chomsky (1992). This interface level allows us to account for both the morphological and syntactic properties of object clitics in Romance.

Finally, I adopted the treatment of null partitive pronouns by Howard on which the clitic EN is posited. EN would identify pro as a partitive by appealing to the principle of local identification of pro without exception.

A) Italian does not admit a phonetically null object with a referential interpretation (i.e., the interpretation of a definite personal pronoun) and requires the realization of an overt accusative pronoun. Brazilian Portuguese, on the other hand, has a referential null object which can be specified as third person singular or plural; the null object alternates with tonic pronouns, whereas the third person clitics have disappeared from the common usage. (B) In Italian, clitic pronouns always appear on the 'highest' verbal form in the clause: the lexical verb in simple tenses and the auxiliary in compound tenses. In Brazilian Portuguese we observe a different distribution: in simple tenses clitics are adjacent to the lexical verb, just as in Italian, but in compound tenses they are cliticized on the participle rather than on the auxiliary. We are interested in explaining which functional head in each language qualifies as a possible host for clitic pronouns. We have assumed the independent syntactic realization of the Agreement features; we have proposed that the degree of 'morphological richness' necessary to legitimate a referential pro consists in the presence of a 'strong' Person head, which morphologically selects Number. We have also proposed that this degree of 'richness' is found in the system of Agreement Subject in Italian, and in the system of Agreement Object in Brazilian Portuguese.

The present paper argues that some Northern French dialects, most particularly Picard, provide clear evidence of another case where subject pronouns have become agreement markers prefixed to finite verbs. Indeed, this variety of French shares with many Northern Italian dialects, but not with Standard French, the following properties: (a) subject doubling, (b) the absence of clitic inversion in certain persons of the verb, (c) the presence of apparent resumptive pronouns in subject relative clauses, and (d) the use of a verbal form with a default third person singular subject marker in wh questions where the extracted element is the subject.

In Avar adverbs agree with the absolutive NP in their clause in the same manner that verbs do. In Maori adverbs agree in the presence or absence of passive morphology with their associated verbs (Anderson 1982). There is some evidence that Spanish has a similar phenomenon. According to Zagona (1990), there exist agent oriented adverbs showing agreement with the subject. In Italian it is possible to have agreement between some adverbs and the subject. As originally discussed in Napoli (1975) there exists in Italian a group of adverbs that show number and gender agreement with the subject. Napoli includes lontano in this group of adverbs. However, according to Saltarelli (p.c.) for him lontano never demonstrates agreement. He, moreover, extends the domain of adverbs demonstrating agreement further to include diritta/o ""directly or straight,"" sicura/o 'surely' and sana/o 'soundly'. These distinctions follow Napoli's analysis; however, there is evidence that the apparent obligatory agreement is based on pragmatic preferences. Speakers, having adverbial agreement, report that the nonagreeing svelto is also available in these contexts. I propose that these environments can be accounted for under an incorporation analysis, where the adverb originates internal to the VP and raises by head movement to ""incorporate"" syntactically into the verb. In proposing this, I am assuming that an adverbial phrase follows the X bar schema, thereby having the potential for both a specifier and a complement position.

Recent research, however, shows that such a view misrepresents the role of phonology. Instead of being somewhat marginal, phonology interacts in interesting ways with each of the other major components of grammar, morphology, syntax and semantics, as is revealed especially in lexical and prosodic phonology. That is, phonology is not just a collection of rules that change one sound into another one, but rather it involves a rich set of structures of its own. It is precisely in relation to these structures that the interface properties are relevant. In this paper, I examine the different interfaces on the basis of Italian, but the conclusions about the nature of the interaction between phonology and the other components of grammar are meant to extend beyond Italian, to the organization of grammar in general.

The traditional claim is that contrastive vowel lengthening in Central Romance originated in open stressed syllables, long after the Latin long vowels disappeared. This proposal, referred to as Open Syllable Lengthening has been defended by such distinguished Romanists as Lausberg 1985: 217, Leonard 1970: 265, and Weinrich 1958. This article reviews some of the typologies of vowel lengthening attested in northern Italian dialects. The basic claim of this work is that the prosodic phenomenon of vowel lengthening is directly constrained by Segmental and Prosodic Optimization and that both tendencies might have a different relative strength depending on the dialect. Recent work by Prince (1990), Prince & Smolensky (1993), McCarthy & Prince (1993), Mester (to appear), Archangeli & Pulleyblank (forthcoming), and Goldsmith (1993) has shown how the concept of optimization is relevant in the study of phonological alternations. First, I present some cases that can be clearly explained by prosodic wellformedness. Section 2 deals with examples where segmental optimization plays a role. Finally, the third section concentrates on cases of partial overlapping between segmental and prosodic optimization tendencies.

The principal conclusion is that in Spanish dialects where postconsonantal voiced obstruents are realized as fricatives, spreading of [+continuant] is at work in these contexts. Spread of [+vocalic] i s involved in the spirantization of postvocalic /b/, /d/ and /g/, as well as onset initial voiced obstruents which follow a voiced obstruent in the coda of the preceding syllable. This explains the differential behavior of Spanish dialects: in some, spirantization of voiced obstruents can be effected by spread of [+continuant], while in others only a [+vocalic] specification, which can only be triggered by a vowel in the nucleus, is able to provide a continuant articulation for /b/, /d/ and /g/. This differential behavior is also reflected in historical developments, where early Romance voiced obstruents apparently spirantized first after vowels, and only later after [+continuant] consonants (cf.

We will concentrate on Gallo Romance, Old French and Italian. Given that Kiparsky (1991) explicitly mentions as a possibility for catalectic elements their ''spellout"" by epenthesis, we will mainly concentrate on cases of epenthesis that might potentially provide corroborating evidence for the assumption of segmentally empty prosodic constituents (that is, catalectic syllables and moras). In section 1, we will first discuss and illustrate the notions degenerate feet and catalexis. Section 2 discusses stress in Gallo Romance and Old French. An analysis of Gallo Romance/Old French phonotactics will be given, that, at first sight, seems to provide some evidence for the assumption (dictated by catalexis theory) of final syllable catalexis. However, on closer inspection it will be argued that, if final syllable catalexis is assumed, a number of problems occur which disappear under an analysis not relying on empty syllables. Section 3 discusses stress in Italian. We will concentrate mainly on cases of final stress in Italian, as they might potentially provide independent evidence for the assumption (dictated by catalexis theory) of final mora catalexis. It will be shown that, although theory predicts the necessity of catalexis, no corroborating evidence for its existence can be found. On the contrary, the segmentally empty, but prosodically relevant constituent for which evidence is available cannot be reduced to catalexis. Section 4 summarizes and discusses the main results of this paper. It will be argued that, by minimally modifying Hayes' (1993) Degenerate foot parameter, the epenthesis facts discussed in this paper can not only be analyzed in a more straightforward way, but also, that one is able to account for the same observations as catalexis theory.

Phonetic evidence was gathered to provide evidence for secondary stress in French in order to determine if stress assignment is sensitive to rhythmic factors. Stress clash, a condition not tolerated in many languages, necessitates the assignment of different levels of stress to two stressed syllables which are adjacent to one another. Such a condition is not permissible in many languages.

Thus, I argue for a conservative view of the structure of the French syllable since the mora fails to manifest any significant role where it should be expected to; that is, in the language's metrical system. In contrast, this paper offers a defense of Selkirk's (1978) formulation of French foot structure and argues, particularly from data based on the deletion of e muet, that adjustments to internal syllable structure are motivated by changes at the foot level.

Experimental results show that the processing of BP overt and nonovert objects is consistent with the leading idea underlying the Overt Pronoun Constraint (OPC) proposed by Montalbetti (84). Experiment 1 compares the processing of overt pronouns and empty categories in object position in BP in structures in which these anaphors are A-bound by a subject and in structures in which they are A-bar-bound by a topic. Results from 48 BP speakers indicate reactivation of the antecedents only by topic-bound gaps and by subject-bound overt pronouns In Experiment 2, the difference between the coreferential vs. bound readings in BP is further investigated by comparing the possibility of the strict and sloppy readings for the overt pronoun and the gap in object position. Based on these experimental results, we argue for the classification of the BP null object as an instance of a null epithet, an empty R-expression with pronominal properties.

My account will be heavily dependent on the analysis of the subjunctive mood which will be argued for in Section 1. I argue that the traditional analysis of the subjunctive in terms of an [IRREALIS] feature fails to account for some crucial parts of its distribution. I then outline an analysis of the subjunctive in terms of Temporal Indefiniteness. In Section 2. I will provide an analysis of the phenomenon of obviation. I will be led to examine closely the notion of Binding Domain within Chomsky's Minimalist Program and revise the definition of the notion of Minimal Domain.

As an alternative explanation, I suggested the Right Dislocation/Clitic Drop Hypothesis as proposed by McKee and Emiliani (1990).

Our results show that the F0 descent in our contours of downstepped H* peaks is not attributable to a time-dependent declination effect. Rather, the height of a given F0 peak can be reliably predicted relative to the value of the peak preceding it by reducing this value by a fixed proportion (also called a downstep ratio').",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.133.16pri,Grammatical Theory and Romance Languages,,978-90-272-3637-1 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1996094317&site=ehost-live,1995,11/1/19 19:16,11/1/19 19:16,197-207,197,207,10,"vi, 330",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 133,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,,"<p>Accession Number: 1996094317.

The Italian construction relies on nominative si, whereas the Romanian one can only be analyzed in terms of middle/passive accusative se. The hypothesis according to which Romanian intransitives combine with middle-passive se sheds new light on the Italian (and Spanish) construction itself. Since this language has both a nominative si and a middle-passive accusative si, constructions of the type si Vintrans are predicted to be systematically ambiguous between an analysis in terms of nominative si, and another one, relying on middle-passive si. This prediction can be tested if we can find Italian constructions in which the analysis in terms of nominative si is illegitimate and that in terms of middle-passive accusative si is possible. In what follows I will argue that it is precisely this situation that characterizes an important contrast among Italian non-finite clauses discovered by Cinque (1988). Dobrovie-Sorin (1986, 1994) agrees with Cinque (1988) regarding (i) the necessity of distinguishing between two types of impersonal si, a ""passivizing"" and a ""non-passivizing"" si and (ii) the idea that only the impersonal passivizing si is legitimate in Italian non-finite clauses. The two analyses are nevertheless radically different.

I argue that the stress system of Romanian is in fact to a large extent predictable, provided one takes into account the close dependence of primary stress on the morphology of the language, and the independence of primary stress from secondary stress. In the following section I present a formal metrical analysis for primary stress, restricted to the basic, morphologically regular cases of the noun system, discussed in 2.1, and of the verb, in 2.2. In section 3 I focus on the relationship between primary and secondary stress, and I present an analysis for the latter.

(1a) illustrates a Tough Clause where the adjective of the 'tough' class is followed by an infinitival complement that must be headed by the preposition de, excluding à. (1b) is the so-called Tough movement (TM) counterpart of (1a), where object-to-subject raising seems to have applied. Looking at the English translation, no other visible modification occurs between the two sentence types, however in French, a systematic change of preposition applies, namely only à can occur with (TM). In this paper I argue that this distribution is but one clue that a proper analysis of TM in French ought to depart from the standard, A-bar Null Operator Construction (NOC) analysis held in GB-Barriers type framework. Consider in particular Browning (1987) who distinguishes two modes of subject-predicate relation.

The fact that Bulgarian PAs never allow nominative NPs corresponds directly with the absence of (finite) TP in their representations. PAs in this language are as a rule control structures (cf. Alexandrova 1994), control being typed by a relevant feature in CP. Apart from control PAs (CPAs) Romance allows non-control PAs (NPAs), where nominative Case becomes available through exceptional means, crucially involving a surrogate T(ense)-feature in Cº (cf. Belletti 1990). Bulgarian PAs have argument structure identical to that of a finite clause and subject-oriented participial agreement. Participial agreement in Romance targets ‘deep’ objects, whether it is accompanied by reduced argument structure or not. The hypothesis is defended that, unlike Bulgarian PAs where Case/agreement licensing is straightforwardly nominative/accusative, Romance PAs can be viewed as the locus for an overlap between two abstract language types, the nominative/accusative (N/A) and the absolutive/ergative (A/E) type.

Some linguists have taken this inversion to be the output of a movement of the verb to a position to the left of the subject. The explanation for the constraints could not be extended to the free inversion construction. It has been shown that movement of the verb in Spanish and Catalan in overt syntax conflicts in important ways with the antisymmetry theory and its implications for the landing sites of clitics. This differentiation between infinitives and imperatives on the one hand, and finite verbs, on the other, is problematic for the overt V-to-C analysis in intcrrogatives. This approach leads to the conclusion that the clitic and verb have moved together as a unit in interrogatives.

It will be shown that the traditional characterization of a certain sound change in Spanish is typologically implausible, and thus it should be seriously reconsidered. At issue here is the evolution of voiced obstruents in the transition from Proto Hispano-Romance to Old Spanish, and ultimately the phonological evolution of obstruents in the history of Spanish up to the medieval period. This paper has two primary objectives. The first is to challenge the SSPC Hypothesis by showing that it is strongly at odds with typological considerations. The second is to propose an alternative scenario fully consistent with the historical record as interpreted by Amado Alonso. I will argue that Old Spanish lacked the phonemic contrast between voiced stops and spirants in (1), and that SPIR never ceased to be a productive low-level allophonic rule throughout the history of Spanish, although the phonological conditions governing its application did undergo certain modifications since its emergence in the proto-language.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.157.16mar,Theoretical Analyses on Romance Languages,,978-90-272-3662-3 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1998095368&site=ehost-live,1998,11/1/19 19:23,11/1/19 19:25,283-316,283,316,33,"viii, 379",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 157,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,10,"<p>Accession Number: 1998095368.

JBRU37J4,journalArticle,1998,"Johnson, Ken","Johnson, Ken",,,,,,The Development of Proclitics and Enclitics in Middle French,The Development Of Proclitics And Enclitics In Middle French,"In this paper I examine how the functional node Agr had a strong influence on the dissimilar grammaticalization patterns of Middle French (MidF) pre-verbal and post-verbal subject pronouns. I propose that the post-verbal subject pronouns grammaticalized more quickly than the pre-verbal variety because they had a closer relationship to Agr at a much earlier period. Section one is a brief outline of the subject pronouns and the basic sentence structure of Old French (OF) and MidF. In section two I review Vance's (1995a) analysis of OF post-verbal subject pronouns and embedded pre-verbal subject pronouns as syntactic clitics and her claim that the embedded subject pronouns decliticized in MidF. The divergent nature of this process and the structural changes associated with it provide an example of the types of factors which affect how a single item, in this case an atonic subject pronoun, may split into two elements which then proceed along different grammaticalization paths. A potential problem arises because decliticization implies a case of degrammaticalization, thus violating the principle which says that grammaticalization is a unidirectional process (Hopper and Traugott 1993). In section three I focus on Agr's role in the grammaticalization of the subject pronouns, making particular reference to Roberts' (1993) analysis of OF and MidF sentence structure.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.157.14joh,Theoretical Analyses on Romance Languages,,978-90-272-3662-3 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1998095365&site=ehost-live,1998,11/1/19 19:23,11/1/19 19:25,249-262,249,262,13,"viii, 379",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 157,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,1,"<p>Accession Number: 1998095365.

While derivational or principle-based approaches to this problem do not cover the attested data, template or surface structure approaches are unconstrained and ultimately predict nothing, and both have difficulty when faced with nonstandard and variable sequences. An alternative is to be found in a framework which allows for constraint interaction, such as Optimality Theory. In this account, unranked constraints and morphological underspecification are combined to produce just the range of variation which is attested in some nonstandard Iberian clitic sequences. In this paper I first examine some previous approaches to clitic sequencing in order to see how they would deal with some cases of variation in nonstandard clitic sequences, and then turn to an Optimality and underspecification treatment of the same facts.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.157.13hea,Theoretical Analyses on Romance Languages,,978-90-272-3662-3 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1998095364&site=ehost-live,1998,11/1/19 19:23,11/1/19 19:25,227-248,227,248,21,"viii, 379",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 157,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,23,"<p>Accession Number: 1998095364.

Nevertheless, the properties of other types of proforms have not received much attention to date. The existence of locative and temporal proforms has been observed by several traditional grammarians and dialectologists: Badía (1947), Corominas and Pascual (1985), Cuervo (1886), DHLE (1972), Espinosa (1946), Menéndez Pidal (1904), Navarro Tomás (1926), Place (1930), Tiscornia (1930), among many others. These studies normally assume a prosodic characterization of the class, without making explicit any theory, and provide some examples of the forms in earlier or dialectal documents. Nevertheless, none of them attempt to determine systematically the morphosyntactic and semantic properties of the forms. In this paper, we show that modern Spanish has a system of locative and temporal weak proforms. We also study their syntactic and semantic properties, with particular emphasis on the latter. Finally, we demonstrate that this system has been active since early Spanish and we compare it to the situation in other neighbouring languages.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.157.12gut,Theoretical Analyses on Romance Languages,,978-90-272-3662-3 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1998095363&site=ehost-live,1998,11/1/19 19:23,11/1/19 19:25,205-225,205,225,20,"viii, 379",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 157,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,9,"<p>Accession Number: 1998095363.

The results which follow from a Fregean-inspired thematic approach lead to an endocentric view of the noun phrase which relies on strictly local binding conditions between determiners (the referential binders) and lexical-conceptual predicates. A major consequence of this perspective reclaims the integrity of the NP construct, in which DP is within the projection of N. Under such a hypothesis the strictly local relations reduce to two: Head-Complement and Specifier-Head.

First, OF/MF OS results in OV sequences, while in the comparable Germanic (SVO) languages, OS always gives VO word order. Second, in contrast to Germanic OS, OF/MF OS is attested with infinitives and periphrastic verb forms. I will argue, however, that OS in the two language families is fundamentally the same, and that the differences lie in the functional structure of clauses in OF/MF, and in the head targeted by verb movement.

Silva-Corvalán (1994:135) held that transfer depends on ""superficially parallel structures"" in the languages in contact. These conclusions suggest that for transfer to take place, the structure of the receiving-language paradigm must be no more developed than that of the source-language. Is transfer possible where the receiving-language has a fuller structural paradigm than the source-language? If so, on what linguistic factors would such transfer depend?

Although borrowing may be a mechanism leading to eventual syntactic change, this type of change is not the outcome of direct borrowing of syntactic structures or rules from one language into another. Rather, as I shall show here, what is borrowed across languages is not syntax but lexicon and pragmatic. I will also demonstrate that this type of borrowing is constrained by the structure of the recipient language, and by general cognitive principles that have been found to operate in the acquisition of natural languages. In addition, the sociolinguistic circumstances of contact need to be taken into consideration. Thus, although it may not be possible to predict that a specific change will occur, it may be possible to delimit, on the basis of general principles, the nature of the changes and constraints that may occur, given certain specific sociolinguistic contexts. Specifically, then, mine is an argument against the existence of syntactic borrowing and not against syntactic change resulting from lexical borrowing or from the transfer of discourse or pragmatic constraints from another language.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.160.18sil,Romance Linguistics: Theoretical Perspectives,,978-90-272-3665-4 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=1998095394&site=ehost-live,1998,11/1/19 19:34,11/1/19 19:35,225-246,225,246,21,"viii, 349",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 160,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,49,"<p>Accession Number: 1998095394.

As a starting point I formulate a developmental hypothesis. This is an extension of a hypothesis by Hyams (1994, 1996), who argues that the well-known phenomenon of Root Infinitives in many child languages is due to the fact that finiteness, or temporal specificity, is optionally specified in early grammar. My hypothesis is stated in (1) and concerns nominal specificity. (1)Developmental hypothesis: Specificity is not always grammatically marked in the grammar of 2-year old children. In order to test this hypothesis, I investigated a syntactic process in Italian child language which involves specificity, namely object clitic placement.

At first glance, any attempt to associate the notion of trochees, especially syllabic trochees, to the phonetics of word-final segments in Oil dialects appears ill-fated, since it is well-known that all the Northern Gallo-Romance varieties have been most deeply affected by phonetic erosion, which has eaten its way even into the root of words, with the result that all these dialects, including Standard French (SF), are oxytonic. It takes exceptional circumstances for a final schwa to be heard anywhere north of a La Rochelle-Genève line. One should thus be prepared to accept that the success of this research be measured by its ability to uncover any kind of evidence for trochees, however indirect or controversial. Were it direct or uncontroversial, as documented by alternations and dynamic phonology, one would clearly observe the presence of trochees rather than vestigial traces. In this case, what can be observed is merely static patterns of distribution.

The negator must be overt only in those cases where it must raise along with the feature-containing verb to Comp at LF, thus becoming invisible to the c-commanding NPI. When the NPI occupies a local position with respect to the negator, Neg recovers its content and the derivation converges at LF. Our analysis also explains the unexpected contrast between wh-islands and other subjacency islands. If lexicalization of the negator is forced by the unavailability of operator raising, any subjacency island (and not just wh-islands) should block the relevant derivation. As pointed out, this is not the case. However, under the assumption that it is the [+wh] feature that is responsible for verb raising prior to the potential LF insertion of Negn, we explain thedifference in grammaticality between these configurations.

In this paper I will concentrate on one of the controversial issues concerning the sonority hierarchy, viz. the status of the Sonority Sequencing Generalization (henceforth SSG): ""In any syllable, there is a segment constituting a sonority peak that is preceded and/or followed by a sequence of segments with progressively decreasing sonority values"" (Selkirk 1984:116). The specific question which will be addressed here is the following: ""[I]s the Sonority Sequencing Generalization an absolute constraint on representations, or simply a preference condition expressing universal markedness values?"" (Blevins 1995:210-211). I argue in favor of the latter option, and try to demonstrate its superiority over a theory imposing absolute sonority-based constraints on the structure of phonological representations.

I have argued, contrary to Pollock (1986) and Rizzi (1990), that the contrast does not crucially depend on the relation between en and its trace, but rather on Case checking. The remnant of G-en contains Case features and therefore can (and must) raise to subject position in order to check those features. The remnant of Q-en lacks Case features and therefore cannot raise to subject position. This analysis strongly supports the claim that the Case features of a DP are located in N and that Feature Checking is an asymmetrical operation. Case is checked in favor of N, the EPP, in favor of T. This analysis also explains the behavior of combien and dont, as well as certain facts involving past participle agreement in French. It was further shown to extend naturally to Italian and Catalan. Finally, this proposal offers an interesting start towards explaining the definiteness restriction observed both in Q-en constructions and in expletive constructions. In both cases, I have suggested that the internal argument checks its Case without moving out of the VP and for this reason, receives an indefinite interpretation.",,Formal Perspectives On Romance Linguistics,1-55619-962-7,,,,1999,9/19/19 16:28,9/19/19 16:28,39-56,39,56,17,,185,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,0,"<p>28th Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages (LSRL XXVIII), PENN STATE UNIV, UNIVERSITY PK, PA, APR 16-19, 1998</p>",book article,,,"Authier, JM and Bullock, BE and Reed, LA",LSRL28,Penn State,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

I have argued that this pattern results from an interaction of both categorical and gradient mechanisms, namely strengthening in the phonology and reduction, overlap, and blending in phonetic implementation. This account is motivated in that it captures both (a) the phonological alternation between strengthened and non-strengthened rhotics and (b) the gradient spatio-temporal operations responsible for turbulent airflow in continuous speech. Since the sonority principles in (14) and (15) hold only in the phonological representation, low-level quantitative modifications in the gestural representation may yield apparent violations. Finally, the special case of word-final prevocalic [r] is explained by an independently motivated phonological representation in which empty timing slots denote word boundaries. This accounts for assibilation of coda flaps in word-final contexts without overgenerating [r] in word-internal contexts.",,Formal Perspectives On Romance Linguistics,1-55619-962-7,,,,1999,9/19/19 16:28,9/19/19 16:28,57-71,57,71,14,,185,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,0,"<p>28th Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages (LSRL XXVIII), PENN STATE UNIV, UNIVERSITY PK, PA, APR 16-19, 1998</p>",book article,,,"Authier, JM and Bullock, BE and Reed, LA",LSRL28,Penn State,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

The best-known approaches are those put forth in Chomsky (1982) and Kayne (1994). In Chomsky (1982), Heavy NP-shift is derived via right-adjunction to VP. Kayne (1994), on the other hand, puts forth a very different view according to which it is not the heavy NP which moves, but all other material. In this paper, I will show that none of the current proposals are able to predict certain binding relations involving shifted Heavy NP in Standard French and in a variant of Standard French spoken in Canada, which I will refer to as Canadian French. 1 In addition, we will see that while Heavy NP-shift in Standard French displays typical A'-properties, this phenomenon in Canadian French has A-properties.

The studies that I have reviewed here have borne out this claim. According to Minimalist theory, differences among languages are to be attributed to the particular lexicon and the morphology of that language, while UG provides a universal base from which L2A may proceed. The evidence reviewed here has shown that interlanguage grammars are indeed UG-constrained and that L2 final state grammars may be near-native as a function of the completeness of morpho-lexical mastery. The fundamental difference between LIA and L2A was suggested to lie in the strategy of acquisition, as Critical Period effects make clear.

In that section, we will show that the conflict in agreement in these constructions is, in fact, only apparent. In Section 2 we will turn to qualitative nominal constructions - the subclass of nominal constructions which we will argue do involve a true instance of conflict in internal and external agreement. This discussion will begin with the introduction of novel French data that show that the animate/inanimate distinction plays a crucial part in determining the external agreement patterns in these constructions. In the remaining sections of the paper, we will draw on a proposal that distinguishes the internal structure of qualitative nominal from that of possessives in order to account for these external agreement patterns in a natural way and we will also show that this analysis provides an account of internal agreement in a manner that paves the way for a formal distinction between the differing agreement mechanisms available in Romance.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.185.14hul,Formal Perspectives On Romance Linguistics,1-55619-962-7,,,,1999,9/19/19 16:28,9/19/19 16:28,179-195,179,195,16,,185,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,0,"<p>28th Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages (LSRL XXVIII), PENN STATE UNIV, UNIVERSITY PK, PA, APR 16-19, 1998</p>",book article,,,"Authier, JM and Bullock, BE and Reed, LA",LSRL28,Penn State,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

This led us to propose that imperatives correspond to a structure lacking a T-projection and that this state of affairs forces the projection of a complement position.

Our analysis draws on several advantages of this theory. Unlike rule-based analyses, we do not require language-specific idiosyncratic rules. Instead, we draw on universally motivated constraints and specify only their language-specific ranking. This approach has the further advantage of providing a simple account of differences across languages and within dialects of the same language by minimal re-ranking, as illustrated by the case of Standard dialects of Italian and Piedmontese. Furthermore, the parallel evaluation of entire phrasal input in OT allowed for the full and correct syllabification of geminates, [sC] clusters, and doubled consonants, without intermediate stages of word syllabification in which such clusters might be only partially syllabifiable. Thus, our analysis has the further advantage of avoiding rule ordering between syllabification, lengthening, and resyllabification.

Prior to the Minimalist Program (Chomsky 1995), it was standardly assumed that structural Case is a requirement for DPs. Yet structural Case (as opposed to inherent Case) is associated with the functional categories in clausal structure, not with predicate argument structure more generally. Only clauses enforce the mapping of arguments, specifically a subject, and the ""displacement"" of arguments to structural Case positions, producing configurationally-based surface grammatical relations. In other categories, argument projection is generally optional, and Case-licensing is trivial in the sense that Case is inherently assigned by the theta-marking head (cf. Chomsky 1981, 1986). NP-movement to structural Case positions is unnecessary and impossible (Chomsky 1986). The issue of interest is why configurational relations are enforced in clauses.

These data suggest that the perspective taken has been incorrect. While it is true that place assimilation is more common in nasal + stop clusters than in nasal + fricative clusters, the broader generalization appears to be that non-homorganicity is less tolerated in nasal +stop clusters than in nasal + fricative clusters. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, I will provide new data from the northern Italian dialects of the Emilia-Romagna region in which non-homorganic nasal clusters are treated in a number of ways. I will show that the analyses previously presented cannot handle these data because the position taken has been too narrow: the issue is not one of assimilation vs. non-assimilation, but homorganicity vs. non-homorganicity. Furthermore, I will show that the best way to account for the variation found in these dialects is by adopting the framework of Optimality Theory (McCarthy & Prince (1993); Prince & Smolensky (1993)).",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.220.19rep,Current Issues in Romance Languages,,978-90-272-3727-9 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2002931101&site=ehost-live,2002,11/6/19 23:16,11/6/19 23:16,271-285,271,285,14,"vi, 403",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 220,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,0,"<p>Accession Number: 2002931101.

Chierchia makes two predictions about bare singulars in languages which have a morphological singular/plural distinction: they should never appear in argument position and they should freely appear in predicative position. Schmitt and Munn 1999 showed that Brazilian Portuguese disconfirms the first prediction. In this paper we argue that English in general disconfirms the second prediction because it does not allow bare singular predicates, even though the Romance languages, including Brazilian Portuguese, do. Our paper thus poses the following questions: (1) a. What allows bare singular count nouns in argument position in BrP but not English (or the other Romance languages)? b. What allows bare singular predicates in Romance but not in English?

The dialect in question is spoken primarily in north-central Spain. Martínez-Gil (1991), a study of rule parameters in Peninsular Spanish phonology, labels this dialect ""Dialect B"" and argues that it can be differentiated from ""Dialect A,"" which corresponds to standard Castilian, by means of rule reordering. This dialect is also alluded to frequently in Hualde's (1989) study on Spanish consonant processes and feature geometries, as well as in Navarro Tomás's (1967) Manual de pronunciación española, which remains a definitive analysis of standard Castilian phonetics. These and other studies generally concur that the dialect spoken in the north-central region is characterized by considerable inter- and intra-speaker variation. 2 It is therefore likely that this dialect is in a state of transition (cf. Labov 1994). 3 A presentation and evaluation the relevant data from Dialect B is followed by a discussion of local conjunction. An Optimality Theoretic analysis is then proposed. It is shown that the principle of local conjunction can be applied to account for unexpected input-to-output mappings which would otherwise pose a problem for Optimality Theoretic analysis.

The analysis, couched within the framework of Optimality Theory, demonstrates that a consistent series of ranked constraints guided the incorporation of Portuguese and Spanish words into Afro-Iberian pidgins and creoles, in essentially the same fashion that Ibero-Romance words were borrowed into African languages. The earliest borrowings employed constraints that were closest to those operating in the principal substratum languages, although the means for satisfying these constraints often differed widely between the incipient pidgins and creoles on the one hand and the African languages on the other.

Many-_if not all- structures with PP fronting also involve ""optional"" features such as topic and focus, the syntax of which also shows crosslinguistic variation.

In such grammars, subjects tend to be null only in certain grammatical persons, which makes the point at which the paradigms of subject pronouns are split between null and non-null subjects rather crucial. The specific split which emerges from the data presented here divides subject pronoun paradigms into two blocks, separating 2G, 3sG and 3PL from 1sG, 1PL and 2PL.

The fact that (1) can be maintained in this case for Spanish of course gives us hope that it can be maintained more generally.

In this fashion it was claimed that syllabification took place at the level of the word, and again later at a phrasal level.  This ordering was able to account for different patterns of syllabification in different contexts, as separate rules were used for each case (Harris 1993, Hualde 1992, among others).  In this paper I re-examine the data relevant to Spanish syllabification, focusing especially on ‘resyllabification’ and the behavior of prefixes in syllabification.  Close analysis of the data leads to the proposal of a morphological status for Spanish prefixes different from what has commonly been assumed.  Taking into account the morphological status of prefixes, I offer an analysis of ‘resyllabification’ within Optimality Theory (OT) (Prince and Smolensky 1993), where, rather than an ordered set of rules, a set of universal constraints, ranked in order of preference by the specific language, operates on the input to produce the actual phonetic output.  The assumption within OT that all constraints operate simultaneously makes the notion of resyllabification impossible.

In languages like English, where the infinitive does not raise, the maximal (overtly filled) structure is ModP, licensing all types of adverbs in that part of the structure. Only these adverbs are also allowed in languages where the infinitive raises high, such as Spanish, which we account for by infinitival movement to F, a functional head above TP. This movement further allows an additional preverbal specifier which we argued can only be a moved constituent such as a topic in Spanish.

In contrast to Chierchia's work, however, the approach explored here does not require a semantic parameter, nor for that matter the systematic presence of a null determiner as in the traditional view. It proposes a parameter that links the necessity of a null determiner to the realization of plural morphology, without, however, excluding it in no-plural languages. The morpho-syntactic parameter proposed here, is of a common nature in generative syntax, linking the presence of a syntactic projection to the richness of its morphological realization.

This paper looks at the diachronic development of Old French and Old Spanish in an effort to account for this variation.

These three factors are: The development of the article, The reduction of unstressed forms, The acquisition of definiteness. Further we will contend that evidence from the dialectal variation in Italian reflects the development of the prenominal possessive in Spanish, suggesting that Spanish and Italian have more in common diachronically than the standard grouping of Spanish with French on the one hand and Italian on the other.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.220.02ant,Current Issues in Romance Languages,,978-90-272-3727-9 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2002931084&site=ehost-live,2002,11/6/19 23:16,11/6/19 23:16,1-15,1,15,14,"vi, 403",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 220,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,0,"<p>Accession Number: 2002931084.

We now know that there are languages which have no contrastive vowel length but which do have word-level, non-morphologically conditioned stress rules based on mora count, some of which are mentioned in Ohsieck (1978). Of course we cannot blame Trubetzkoy for not knowing all the languages of the world. We can certainly not blame him for not having observed that Spanish and Portuguese are examples of languages that count moras despite the fact that they have no long vowels. Stress in these languages is used distinctively and is therefore non-automatic. This is, in the eyes of a European structuralist, in contradiction with the idea that it can be rule governed. We had to wait for a completely different conception of what a phonological generalization may look like, in order to state the Romance stress facts as being rule governed.

This constraint makes sense of the acquisition pattern of Dutch syllable structure (Section 2) and is shown to play a key role in explaining the suppletive distribution of the masculine plural definite article in Italian (Section 3.1) and the exceptional behavior of h-aspiré words with respect to optional schwa deletion in French (Section 4.1). Interestingly, the local domains of relevance for (ONSET&NOCODA) are found to differ in the Italian/Dutch vs. French cases, thereby challenging the hypothesis that conjoined constraints absolutely self-define their domains. Domain-indexation, independently proposed for self-conjoined constraints, may thus be more generally necessary in Local Conjunction. {ONSET&NOCODA} does not go unviolated in either Italian or French. The allomorphic distribution of the masculine singular definite article in Italian (Section 3.2) and 'liaison sans enchainement' in French (Section 4.2) are cases in point and are analyzed in some detail. Besides Local Conjunction, other general issues touched upon in this paper include the cross-theoretical evidence provided by suppletion in favor of Optimality Theory (OT), the nature of mental representations in relation to surface allomorphs, and the formalization of variation within OT.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.217.15tra,Romance Phonology and Variation,,978-90-272-3724-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2002933177&site=ehost-live,2002,11/6/19 21:38,11/6/19 21:43,191-218,191,218,27,"x, 238",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 217,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,26,"<p>Accession Number: 2002933177.

This remarkable survival stems from the convergence of several factors, including a nearly unbroken--if unflattering--literary tradition, a poignant if inaccurate awareness of early child language, and a conscious decision to homogenize Spanish grammar to a degree not found in spontaneous second language acquisition. It is the latter phenomenon which sets Spanish foreigner talk apart from the majority of La Spanish varieties, in whose evolution native speaker simplification has played an insignificant role. At the root of the decision by native speakers to use a contrived language is the perceived status of the pidginizing group, the likelihood that the La speakers can and will acquire and understand complete Spanish, and the necessity for sustained communication between native speakers and the L2-speaking group. Non-interference with second language speakers' acquisition of Spanish is the unmarked case, and results in varieties such as Afro-Hispanic bozal language and the actually occurring La Spanish of Anglophone Central Americans, Chinese speakers, and North Africans (Casado-Fresnillo 1995, Tarkki 1995), The original Lingua Franca, a comprehensive Romance-based contact language formed with the active collaboration of speakers of languages cognate with Spanish, never fully disappeared beneath the horizon as the Spanish language evolved and spread to other continents. In circumstances in which communication with groups felt-if only grudgingly--to be essential trade partners, Spanish speakers have always been able to slip back into a form of discourse which owes little to coincidental similarity or the meanderings of universal grammar. The ready availability of this artificially generated but culturally potent linguistic template has at times deflected attention away from contact languages formed through natural selection, and in which substratum and universal features predominate over intentional simplification.",,Romance Phonology and Variation,,978-90-272-3724-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2002933173&site=ehost-live,2002,11/6/19 21:38,11/6/19 21:40,117-143,117,143,26,"x, 238",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 217,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,39,"<p>Accession Number: 2002933173.

Broadly speaking, we can call these two systems the etymological (or case-based) system and the referential system. The latter system includes the usages termed loismo, leismo, and laismo in the Hispanic philological tradition. These two types of pronominal paradigms make differential use of morphological contrasts based on features such as [DATIVE], [FEMININE], [PLURAL], and in some referential varieties, the distinction between [COUNT] and MASS] nouns. But an analysis which treats these as binary features and allows for their free combination in unordered matrices seriously overpredicts the number of surface contrasts, whereas the attested pronoun paradigms are in fact highly constrained. This paper proposes a Feature Geometry account which allows for the attested range of variation in pronoun paradigms without opening the door to unconstrained variation.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.217.07hea,Romance Phonology and Variation,,978-90-272-3724-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2002933169&site=ehost-live,2002,11/6/19 21:38,11/6/19 21:42,55-68,55,68,13,"x, 238",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 217,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,19,"<p>Accession Number: 2002933169.

This analysis draws on several advantages of OT. First, by formulating the NSR as a violable constraint, I have suggested that there is no need to abandon it as a tool in the analysis of sentential stress assignment. In languages like English, where it is a low-ranking constraint, we expect its effects to be overridden by other higher-ranking constraints. However, in the cases of sentence focus, where satisfaction of the constraints that dominate the NSR is not at stake, its effects are still observed. Secondly, an analysis of Focus-related subject inversion in Spanish is arrived at through the languagespecific ranking of the same constraints operational in English. Concretely, in Spanish the NSR dominates the SUBJECT constraint, whereas English has the opposite ranking. Unlike previous analyses, both derivational and Optimalitytheoretic, this result is achieved without the need to appeal to a stipulative ALIGN-FOCUS constraint, a Focus Phrase, or language-specific intonational properties distinguishing both languages. Lastly, the analysis explains why VOS sentences in Spanish necessarily have an interpretation in which the subject is the focus, all else being equal, a VOS sentence will always be less harmonious with respect to the SUBJECT and STAY constraints than the SVO and VSO candidates. Only when satisfaction of the NSR and FOC constraints is at stake can this candidate be more harmonious than the SVO and VSO candidates and thus emerge as the winner.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.217.06gut,Romance Phonology and Variation,,978-90-272-3724-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2002933168&site=ehost-live,2002,11/6/19 21:38,11/6/19 21:41,39-53,39,53,14,"x, 238",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 217,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,39,"<p>Accession Number: 2002933168.

This distribution, although complex, is largely predictable for standard French or, more accurately, le français de référence. Despite such regularity, the same language internal data have spawned numerous competing theoretical interpretations over the last few decades. Extant analyses rely in varying degrees on a distinction between ""true' diphthongs which are nuclear and derived or ""false” ones in which a glide, derived from an underlying high vowel, is parsed consonantally as part of the syllable onset. Here, this distinction will be shown to be untenable. In this article, I examine language-external evidence that points to how speakers of French actually treat surface glide-vowel (GV) sequences in linguistic performance. A great deal of external evidence - from child language to language games and dialectal variation - converges on a view of glides in French as essentially part of a complex syllable nucleus. In essence, although most linguistic descriptions of the phonetics of the language claim that diphthongs do not exist in French, external data based on speakers' linguistic behavior show instead that rising diphthongs are quite plentiful and that they need not be assumed to derive from their corresponding high vowel counterparts. Instead, what drives the distinction between dieresis (VV) and diphthongs (GV) across different language varieties is markedness  interactions with faithfulness constraints.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.217.04bul,Romance Phonology and Variation,,978-90-272-3724-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2002933166&site=ehost-live,2002,11/6/19 21:38,11/6/19 21:41,11-25,11,25,14,"x, 238",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 217,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,9,"<p>Accession Number: 2002933166.

While I mainly concentrate on their distribution in the complement clause of propositional attitude predicates, ultimately, my goal is to determine an account that unifies as much as possible all the different uses of the subjunctive mood in Spanish. The proposal presented here departs from the widespread idea that a criterion related to the realis/irrealis notion plays a relevant role in the distribution of subjunctive mood.

RLRMJVH3,journalArticle,2001,"Sagarra, Nuria","Sagarra, Nuria",,,,,,The Role of Syntactic Modifications on L2 Oral Comprehension,The Role Of Syntactic Modifications On L2 Oral Comprehension,"The role of input in second language acquisition (SLA) has been the focus of much SLA research and theory for the last two decades. Input processing depends on the second language learners' limited capacity to process and store incoming information (McLaughlin 1987, VanPatten 1996). If the demands of a task exceed what learners can attend to at a given point in time, either processing will slow down or storage will decrease, resulting in poor comprehension. This phenomenon is especially evident at early stages of acquisition, because limited knowledge and expectations about the second language demand a greater amount of cognitive effort. One way of reducing this cognitive effort to make both input comprehensible and communication possible consists of simplifying the input (Hatch 1983). According to the Input Hypothesis (Krashen 1980, 1982, 1985), SLA needs the presence of comprehensible input to occur. Input becomes comprehensible by means of linguistic simplifications and modifications to discourse structure (e.g., negotiated interaction) (Long 1983, 1985; Pica, Young & Doughty 1987). If linguistic and interaction adjustments promote comprehension of input, and comprehensible input promotes acquisition, it could be deduced that such modifications indirectly promote acquisition (Long 1985). The aim of this study is to examine the role that simplified syntax plays in facilitating comprehension in the second language classroom with elementary learners. The present study, thus, investigates the nature of teacher talk rather than foreigner talk or native talk (see Freed 1995 and Terrell 1995 for a discussion of these terms).",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.216.15sag,"Romance Syntax, Semantics and L2 Acquisition",,978-90-272-3723-1 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2001931806&site=ehost-live,2001,11/6/19 21:37,11/6/19 21:37,197-210,197,210,13,"x, 246",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 216,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,,"<p>Accession Number: 2001931806.

X225ALQ2,journalArticle,2001,"Cummins, Sarah","Cummins, Sarah",,,,,,Unaccusativity and the Impersonal Construction of French,Unaccusativity And The Impersonal Construction Of French,"This article argues that the Impersonal Contruction (IC) of French, which displays unaccusative syntax but allows unergative verbs, refutes the Unaccusative Hypothesis (UH) and the principles of lexically driven mapping. It is demonstrated that three types of argument intended to explain unaccusative mismatches are untenable while maintaining the UH. An account of the verbs appearing in the IC is proposed, based on the principles of free linking of arguments and postsyntactic compositional interpretation, taking into account meaning contributed by diverse sources, including lexical, syntactic, constructional, and morphological meaning, which must be compatible. It is argued that the shape of IC sentences requires that a state of affairs be predicated of a locative; various consequences for verb and argument selection and tense arise from this requirement. By removing certain semantico-syntactic functions from the lexicon, economy is achieved in both the lexicon and the syntactic component.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.216.09cum,"Romance Syntax, Semantics and L2 Acquisition",,978-90-272-3723-1 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2001931800&site=ehost-live,2001,11/6/19 21:37,11/6/19 21:37,89-103,89,103,14,"x, 246",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 216,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,0,"<p>Accession Number: 2001931800.

We have shown that despite superficial appearance, the wh- movement and wh-in situ variants of French questions do not involve syntactic optionality, in particular, optionality of movement. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that no unified syntactic account of both types of wh-questions is possible because there exist fundamental interpretive differencesbetween them. These differences lie in the role of presupposition which is associated with the wh-in situ, but not with the fronted wh-phrase. We proposed that the difference in presuppositionality is reflected in the morphological makeup of wh-phrases in both cases. Specifically, we suggested that the wh-in situ is headed by a silent definite head D° while the wh-phrase that undergoes movement is not.

I will discuss constraints determining the possible syntactic structures and associated meanings bare nominals (BNs) can have. In earlier work (Déprez 1999, 2001), I have shown that an approach attributing this crosslinguistic variation to a semantic parameter in the denotation of noun phrases (Chierchia 1998), although clearly very insightful, makes a number of incorrect empirical predictions with respect to a certain class of languages, and in particular with respect to Haitian Creole (HC). More speciﬁcally, Chierchia’s proposal was designed to exclude bare singular arguments and to predict the necessary presence of classiﬁers in languages that do not mark plurality. Both predictions, however, are contradicted by the Haitian data. My paper introduced an alternative approach based on a syntactic parameter, the Plural Parameter, to provide an account of the syntactic and semantic properties of BNs in HC. The present paper extends this syntactically inspired approach to account for more extensive cross-linguistic variations in the meanings of BNs in Creole as well as in non-Creole languages. As it presents work in progress – I have not yet looked at all the known languages featuring BNs – the conclusions it presents are preliminary. Moreover, space constraints allow me to touch only on the broad outlines of the proposal. Various aspects will have to be left for future work. My hope, however, is that this work will contribute progress towards a better understanding of the complex interaction of morphology, syntax and semantics in this area of research.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.238.22dep,A Romance Perspective on Language Knowledge and Use,,978-90-272-4750-6 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2004931549&site=ehost-live,2003,11/6/19 23:39,11/6/19 23:39,291-310,291,310,19,"xv, 384",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 238,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,4,"<p>Accession Number: 2004931549.

First, we examine the proportions of default forms found in the children utterances in both languages. We follow up on the original suggestion by Grinstead (1998) that third person singular present indicative forms may actually be default forms in Catalan and probe the data further. Next, we examine the time course of the acquisition of tense and agreement. Whereas French children begin to acquire tense ﬁrst, Catalan child speech initially contains agreeing but not tensed utterances. Furthermore, while Catalan children exhibit a linear increase in the acquisition of both tense and agreement, French children exhibit a stage where there is competition for the realization of functional categories. Finally, a detailed analysis for the Catalan child Laura is developed as an example of how Optimality Theory can account for variation both within and across languages.In this paper, we have presented three main ﬁndings. First, while French has always been considered an optional inﬁnitive language, it has been assumed that Catalan is not.

BVPCVNK5,journalArticle,2003,"Cipria, Alicia","Cipria, Alicia",,,,,,Spanish Perception Verbs and Sequence of Tenses: Aktionsart Effects,Spanish Perception Verbs And Sequence Of Tenses: Aktionsart Effects,"This article examines perception verbs when used with tensed complements, especially when the complement is in one of the two simple past tenses of Spanish, viz the imperfecto or the pretérito. Past tense complements are particularly interesting due to the different interpretations they receive when embedded under perception verbs. I argue that the temporal relations across a complex clause with a main perception verb are not as simple as claimed in prior literature. Rather, the interaction of aspect/aktionsart and pragmatics with the lexical requirement of the main verb plays a role in the resultant temporal interpretations. Since perception verbs mostly take indicative complements, the issues discussed here bring interesting points to the general issue of “sequence of tense(s)”, which in the Spanish literature, has been dealt mostly within the context of subjunctive complements. It is to be hoped that this contribution will add to the ongoing discussion on sequence of tense by showing the issues involved in the interpretation of indicative complements in general, and perception complements in particular. The elements of aspect, aktionsart, and pragmatic and embedding effects (associated with the complement tenses) bring out a whole new array of factors that need to be considered in the evaluation of the complement tense. Needless to say, this implies that analyses incorporating notions such as “[–Tense]” for the complement, as well as those that posit copying rules to make the tenses match, will need to be re-evaluated in light of this discussion.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.238.20cip,A Romance Perspective on Language Knowledge and Use,,978-90-272-4750-6 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2004931547&site=ehost-live,2003,11/6/19 23:39,11/6/19 23:39,253-272,253,272,19,"xv, 384",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 238,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,1,"<p>Accession Number: 2004931547.

The ﬁrst question is whether the IO doubling construction (IODC) in (2b) should be assimilated to the DOC in (1b). The second question is whether there is a transformational relationship between the prepositional dative and the DOC (and between the corresponding Spanish constructions). I have provided new data based on idioms to support the conclusion that the Spanish IODC should be assimilated to the English DOC. I have also presented evidence for the alternate projection analysis of DOCs proposed by Harley (2000). By deﬁning DOCs as those constructions having (28) as their underlying structure, I have shown that we can isolate properties which depend on this structure as being deﬁning characteristics of the construction. These properties can then be applied to constructions in other languages to help us detect the P have structure. We have determined that the semantic factors and the possibility of certain types of idioms are reliable indicators of the P have structure. We can also use binding to detect underlying structure, but caution must be used since surface movement of the elements will also affect the binding possibilities and obscure the underlying structure. In English, the surface word order lines up with the underlying structure in both the DOC and the prepositional dative.

We suggest that contact-induced changes should additionally be understood in terms of the notion of adaptation . We outline how an adaptive model adds to a simpliﬁcatory one, and apply the notion of adaptation to the study of the most common of all contact phenomena, namely cross-language lone lexical insertions, in one of the most complex contact settings in North America, New York City (henceforth NYC). Speciﬁcally, we apply the notion of adaptation to the study of English lexical insertions (henceforth ELIs) in the Spanish spoken in NYC. Our ELIs are lone English-origin words that appear in an otherwise Spanish discourse. For reasons that we discuss in the Limitations section below, we do not distinguish in our ELIs between borrowings and single-word codeswitches. This distinction is controversial, but it appears increasingly feasible after the results of research by Poplack and her followers (cf. Poplack & Meechan 1998; Turpin 1998; Budzhak-Jones 1998; and other studies in the same volume). As in nearly all contact situations, most of the ELIs in NYC Spanish are nouns. We use adaptive reasoning to test speciﬁc predictions regarding simpliﬁcatory changes involving these nouns, focusing on the nearly complete lack of applicability of the Spanish arbitrary gender system to this portion of our informants’ vocabulary. We see the new facts revealed by these predictions as useful expansions of our empirical knowledge regarding Spanish in NYC, and as support for the idea that contact-induced change is adaptive.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.238.17oth,A Romance Perspective on Language Knowledge and Use,,978-90-272-4750-6 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2004931545&site=ehost-live,2003,11/6/19 23:39,11/6/19 23:39,209-229,209,229,20,"xv, 384",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 238,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,48,"<p>Accession Number: 2004931545.

I will attempt to demonstrate that in spoken Spanish, for lexical noun phrases, the expression of topic correlates with word order and with given referent. It does not correlate with prosodic prominence. Also, topic shift and topic continuity do not correlate with primary stress placement. I will also try to establish a cognitive motivation for the word order of the topical NP. Finally, I will discuss a construction-type in which the topic appears in last position in the sentence. This study is based on a corpus of 20 hours of informal conversations with a total of 32 middle class speakers, natives of La Plata, Argentina. In order to avoid the inﬂuence of additional factors, only simple clauses were considered in the analysis. This work is based on the following construction-types: SV, AV, 1 VO, AVO, AVAdv, VOAdv, NPsubject Copula Adj. To conclude, we see that the notion of topic is linguistically manifested in Spanish. Empirical data show that the lexical constituent whose referent has a topic relationship with the rest of the proposition appears in ﬁrst position in the sentence and tends to be given . Topical constituents may receive any type of stress or be unstressed, while statistically they tend to receive primary or secondary stress. Topical subjects with new referents tend to receive primary stress. Topical subjects with given referents tend to receive secondary stress. No correlation between topic shift and stress placement has been found in AVO constructions.

In order to do this, the study quantiﬁes the production of accusative forms by three groups of speakers divided according to the age of ﬁrst contact with English. Our hypothesis suggests that the frequency of accusative clitics will decrease as the amount of contact with English increases. The reduction in the number of accusative pronouns will lead to an increase in frequency of use of the following forms: (1) the reiteration of the NP, (2) the use of the pronoun eso, (3) dative clitics in accusative contexts, (4) duplication, (5) the reassignment of gender and/or number, and (6) the omission of the clitic.
The results of the quantitative analysis conﬁrm that there is a process of simpliﬁcation at work within the third person accusative pronouns in the MexicanAmerican variety of Spanish spoken in Houston.

Presently, we shall examine the choice of the preposition introducing indirect objects in ditransitive constructions in a variety of BP spoken in Fortaleza. In this capital of the Northeastern state Ceará, the elimination of a is less radical. It will be demonstrated that the variation between a and para is embedded in the linguistic matrix in terms of two statistically signiﬁcant variables, namely the features [+/–(potentially) light] on the verb and [+/–referential] on the nominal in the direct object position (henceforth DO nominal). It will be further shown that these features are encoded in the conceptual structure of the predicate. The discussion will be developed as follows: in Section 2, the quantitative analysis will be provided, with respect to the statistically signiﬁcant independent variables; in Section 3, the results of the quantitative analysis will be discussed in terms of the conceptual structure of the predicate. This discussion will follow Hale and Keyser’s (1993, 1998) theory of argument structure and Salles’ (1997) analysis of the dative alternation in English, in which a correlation between affectedness and referentiality is proposed.

In order to answer this question, we need to look at other modal uses of the Imperfect. In this paper I have argued that Past can be interpreted outside the proposition in which it occurs. Indeed, sometimes it must be interpreted outside in order to avoid a semantic clash with other temporal elements such as adverbs, which would lead to an uninterpretable structure. These are the modal uses of past. I also argued that the time information in the accessibility relation is responsible for the time of the epistemic state relevant for the felicity conditions of the sentence in question. So, if past constrains the time-argument of the accessibility relation (as in the case of ICs), the felicity conditions will provide information about the speaker’s past epistemic states. If the time-argument of the accessibility relation picks the utterance time as default value, then the felicity conditions will involve talking about the speaker’s epistemic state at the utterance time. The falsity of the antecedent was then shown to be a scalar implicature.

We argue that there is a class of NPIs which have propositional content and which present new challenges for a general theory of NPI licensing and meaning. Such a theory should incorporate attention to scales of different types, and speciﬁcally in the case of que digamos scales of expectations. In this respect, our contribution can be ascribed to a longstanding tradition in the study of NPIs based on pragmatic scales and ordered entailments, along the lines initially proposed by Horn (1972) and Fauconnier (1975). More interestingly, it also provides arguments in favor of a more ﬁne-grained understanding of the ingredients of polarity licensing, an understanding in which structural factors combine with or are superseded by semantic and pragmatic constraints. We have argued that que digamos is a propositional NPI with scalar properties, but, unlike other propositional NPIs in Spanish (as well as in other languages), it conveys as part of its conventional semantic content attenuating meaning instead of emphatic meaning. Based on its possible licensors, it can be classiﬁed as a strong NPI. Its main pragmatic function in discourse is to contravene scalar expectations, whether explicit or implicit. It invokes a pragmatic scale of expectations and indicates that the proposition it marks is less expected, or more unexpected, than some alternative proposition(s) located on the same scale.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.238.11gut,A Romance Perspective on Language Knowledge and Use,,978-90-272-4750-6 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2004931539&site=ehost-live,2003,11/6/19 23:39,11/6/19 23:39,119-131,119,131,12,"xv, 384",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 238,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,2,"<p>Accession Number: 2004931539.

In Section 2, we take up and develop a proposal ﬁrst made by Jacobs (1984, 1991) according to which Focus belongs to illocutionary semantics (i.a., Zaefferer 1981; Han 2000). In Section 3, we develop a deﬁnition of Discourse Topic (henceforth DT) proposed by Büring (1997) in order to deﬁne the notions of Ground and Given. In both sections, we motivate our deﬁnitions with arguments drawn from the analysis of intonation; in Section 4, we brieﬂy consider an argument drawn from word order in French. We have shown that an illocutionary approach to Focus makes it possible to unify the analysis of the distribution of illocutionary boundary tones in French. It naturally calls for a dynamic approach to the transfer of information in discourse. A piece of information is not new (informative) or old (shared) per se . The update of assertions is constituted by the content that is speciﬁcally asserted. The update requested from the hearer by questions is delimited by the content that is speciﬁcally questioned. Secondly, an explicit deﬁnition of what Discourse Topic is allows a description of the obligatory placement of one type of pitch accent in French.

In Section 4, a categorical distinction is introduced re-conﬁguring RF in terms of two grammatical types (lexical and functional) and the ensuing typology is discussed in a preliminary re-evaluation of old and new data.The conclusions reached in this paper lead to a reformulation of the ‘regular/irregular’ deﬁnition of raddoppiamento (15) as a grammatically based dichotomy between lexical and functional triggers (16).

Contrary to the prevailing assumption that /s/ reduction diffuses from syllable ﬁnal to syllable initial position, we ﬁnd a higher frequency of aspiration/deletion word medially in syllable initial position ( e s e ) than in syllable ﬁnal position ( e s te ). In striking contrast to the familiar pattern in aspirating Caribbean, South American, and Andalusian dialects, in the Chihuahua data we ﬁnd that the frequency of aspiration and deletion word ﬁnally is higher before a pause or a vowel than before a consonant. Given this nonconforming pattern, we compare constraint hierarchies for /s/ reduction syllable ﬁnally and initially and show that following phonological environment makes the greatest contribution syllable ﬁnally, while preceding environment is the most important linguistic constraint syllable initially. This pair of results, higher /s/ reduction prevocalically than preconsonantally and different phonetic conditioning for /s/ reduction syllable ﬁnally and initially, provides evidence against the model in Figure 1 and more generally, against a unitary process of aspiration extending from syllable ﬁnal to syllable initial position in Spanish.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.238.05bro,A Romance Perspective on Language Knowledge and Use,,978-90-272-4750-6 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2004931534&site=ehost-live,2003,11/6/19 23:39,11/6/19 23:39,21-38,21,38,17,"xv, 384",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 238,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,4,"<p>Accession Number: 2004931534.

E73HJTFZ,journalArticle,2003,"Auger, Julie","Auger, Julie",,,,,,Pronominal Clitics in Picard Revisited,Pronominal Clitics In Picard Revisited,"This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarizes the analysis of subject clitics presented in Auger (1994a) and its implications for non-subject clitics. Section 3 introduces the general pattern which characterizes vowel epenthesis in the variety of Picard that is spoken in the Vimeu region and examines the behavior of vowel epenthesis in clitic sequences. Finally, Section 4 builds on previous analyses of vowel epenthesis across word boundaries in Vimeu Picard (Auger 2001) and proposes an OT analysis of epenthesis as it applies inside clitic + verb clusters. The conclusion reached in this paper concerning the morphophonological status of Picard pronominal clitics is not necessarily generalizable to other Romance languages. However, the methodology is. Thus, it should be possible to examine such phonological processes as affrication in Québec colloquial French (QCF) to determine whether pronominal clitics in this variety are afﬁxes. Quite interestingly, variable affrication in sequences involving a pronominal clitic followed by a high front vowel as in ça t’irait [‘it would suit you’] and t’imagines [‘you imagine’] contrasts with categorical affrication inside words (e.g., tirer [t s i t e] [‘to pull’]) and would appear to support a non-afﬁxal analysis of these elements, thus calling into question this part of Auger’s (1994b) analysis. Given this observation, a fuller investigation of the morphophonological of pronominal clitics in QCF is deﬁnitely called for.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.238.04aug,A Romance Perspective on Language Knowledge and Use,,978-90-272-4750-6 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2004931533&site=ehost-live,2003,11/6/19 23:39,11/6/19 23:39,3-20,3,20,17,"xv, 384",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 238,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,7,"<p>Accession Number: 2004931533.

L7YL45SI,journalArticle,2003,"Prévost, Philippe","Prévost, Philippe",,,,,,On the Nature of Root Infinitives in Adult L2 French,On The Nature Of Root Infinitives In Adult L2 French,"Here I report early findings of an ongoing study of RIs in the speech of 4 adult learners of French (Ll=English). Participants were all beginners at the start of the investigation. The methodology tested for knowledge of finiteness and functional categories (section 4). Special care was taken in the transcription of verbal forms. The goal was to compare the results with the findings on anglophone children learning French (Prévost, 1997; Prévost & White, 1999). In this study, I considered several hypotheses about the knowledge of functional categories in adult L2 acquisition, and the presence of these categories in the underlying representation of RIs. According to the MSIH and the TH, functional categories are part of early L2 grammars, but these two approaches differ on the nature of RIs. For the TH, functional categories are absent from underlying representations; RIs are considered to be VPs. On the MSIH, L2 learners have difficulty mapping morphology and syntax, which results in their producing verb forms which are superficially nonfmite but occur in finite positions. On the impairment view, functional categories are either considered not to be part of interlanguage grammars, or their features are held to be permanently impaired. In both cases, this means that there should be no relation between finiteness and verb placement. In general the results of the adult anglophone learners of L2 French investigated here confirm the predictions of the MSIH, and not those of the TH and the IRH: nonfmite forms appear in CPs, they are found with DP and clitic subjects, and the temporal interpretation of RIs does not differ from that of overtly finite root declaratives. Although nonfmite verbs appear in finite positions, the learners have knowledge of finiteness since finite verbs are not found in nonfmite positions (except for Jane's data, to which I return below). The variability in verb placement is much more restricted than would be expected on an impairment account.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.244.25pre,Romance Linguistics: Theory and Acquisition,,978-90-272-4756-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2003933244&site=ehost-live,2003,11/7/19 17:56,11/7/19 18:47,367-384,367,384,17,"viii, 388",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 244,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,12,"<p>Accession Number: 2003933244.

U5ALXW67,journalArticle,2003,"Plunkett, Bernadette","Plunkett, Bernadette",,,,,,Null Subjects and the Setting of Subject Agreement Parameters in Child French,Null Subjects And The Setting Of Subject Agreement Parameters In Child French,"Much recent work links the phenomenon of child null subjects to finiteness, especially Tense. Some authors have claimed that such null subjects are essentially limited to non-finite contexts and are thus best characterised as PRO. This paper discusses data from European and Canadian varieties of child French in which the majority of null subjects occur with morphologically finite verbs. The use of null subjects with finite and non-finite verbs is clearly distinct. In contrast to the stable use of null subjects with the latter, their use with finite verbs decreases steadily between the ages of 2 and 3, suggesting that the null subjects in the two clause types do not have the same status. On close examination, the gradual disappearance of null subjects in finite clauses can be shown to progress essentially pronoun by pronoun. This pattern can be explained by appeal to aspects of the immature agreement system, with agreement parameters on T being set one by one. We have seen that the gradual increase in the use of overt pronominal subjects in child French proceeds essentially pronoun by pronoun and that this can be explained if the acquisition of agreement involves the successive setting of PERSON and NUMBER parameters on T. The pattern of pronominal subject use is not simply one in which pronouns emerge one by one and once acquired, are then used consistently. Rather, a pronoun appears only once the parameters on T that allow it to be used have been set. The attested development thus supports the adoption of the Agreement Hypothesis over the Tense Hypothesis in the explanation of child null subjects in French. Although, during the process of acquiring agreement on T, pronouns sometimes undergo further classification, the succession of steps proposed never requires the child to set a parameter and later to retreat from a particular parameter setting.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.244.24plu,Romance Linguistics: Theory and Acquisition,,978-90-272-4756-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2003933243&site=ehost-live,2003,11/7/19 17:56,11/7/19 18:46,351-366,351,366,15,"viii, 388",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 244,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,5,"<p>Accession Number: 2003933243.

The explanation rests on the assumption that in the interaction between nature and nurture that takes place in the process of language acquisition, L1 children approach data via a primary domain-specific procedure (a 'bottom-up' procedure primarily geared to the dissection of the smallest language units) which makes them sensitive to the linguistic triggers that will be realized as abstract features. This leads to parameter-setting and native-like competence. In the case of adult L2 learners, the 'top-down' procedure —the processing of larger units— that characterizes their mature language faculty prevents them from 'capturing' the abstract value of linguistic triggers (cf. Vainikka & Young-Scholten 1988 for a similar proposal), which leads to local (as opposed to parameter-setting) learning and to non-native competence.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.244.23lic,Romance Linguistics: Theory and Acquisition,,978-90-272-4756-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2003933242&site=ehost-live,2003,11/7/19 17:56,11/7/19 18:46,317-350,317,350,33,"viii, 388",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 244,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,9,"<p>Accession Number: 2003933242.

Secondly, we present our view on bilingual first language acquisition and make some predictions for the acquisition of the phenomenon considered here. In the third section, we present the procedure and the material of the (monolingual) experiment and we discuss its results. In the fourth section, we present the bilingual experiment and its results, and in the discussion section we compare the results of the bilingual experiment with the ones from the monolingual experiment, returning to the two main questions raised in the introduction. Finally, we summarize the main findings in the conclusion. In this article, we experimentally examined the acquisition of beaucoup ' at a distance' (the so-called QAD-construction) by bilingual French/Dutch children between the ages 2;8 and 7;5. We reduplicated a computer-run grammaticality judgement test carried out on monolingual French children by Labelle & Valois (to appear). The two main questions we aimed to answer were: (i) do these children know that beaucoup 'at a distance' can quantify over the object, but not over the subject? and (ii) do these bilingual children differ in their judgements from the monolingual children tested by Labelle & Valois? Our results show that the acquisition pattern of the bilingual children was the same as that of the monolingual children. The only difference we found was that the bilingual children showed a slight delay with respect to the monolingual children. We suggested that this delay can be explained by the cross-linguistic influence of Dutch, their other language, in the way proposed by Hulk & Müller in earlier work.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.244.22hul,Romance Linguistics: Theory and Acquisition,,978-90-272-4756-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2003933241&site=ehost-live,2003,11/7/19 17:56,11/7/19 18:45,299-316,299,316,17,"viii, 388",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 244,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,1,"<p>Accession Number: 2003933241.

In conclusion, then, we assume that when learners encounter a word with which they aren't familiar, and do not have stored in their lexicon, they must resort to other tools to pronounce it in the L2. First, if they know the word is Spanish, they know the probability is that stress will be penultimate. Then they search for other similar exemplars - through analogy - in their L2, if they can. Since the L2 lexicon is limited at lower proficiency levels and is restricted to high-frequency words, though, they may not find a suitable match for an atypical token such as barnetal . In cases like this, they then turn to their L1 lexicon, which is available for analogical connections. Our results show that they are indeed looking for similar exemplars (for both real and synthetic words), particularly at the beginning and intermediate stages of learning. Notably, they make more analogies to Spanish words than to English words (except in the case of cognates). English analogies seem to take place when the target word is really odd - as in the case of barnetal - and they can't find any similar Spanish exemplar. These results are compatible with an analogical approach: learners improve gradually as their L2 lexicon grows because a larger lexicon results in a greater ability to make predictions that match the probabilities that are inherent in the L2 lexicon.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.244.21bul,Romance Linguistics: Theory and Acquisition,,978-90-272-4756-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2003933240&site=ehost-live,2003,11/7/19 17:56,11/7/19 18:43,281-297,281,297,16,"viii, 388",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 244,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,20,"<p>Accession Number: 2003933240.

In particular, we show that comparing Leo's data to those of various monolingual Germanand Italian-speaking children provides two sources of evidence for the SSH, one based on the Root Infinitive (RI) phenomenon and the other based on participial constructions. Section 2 of this paper will focus on the occurrences of RIs, which are found in monolingual German but not in monolingual Italian. By showing that such a dichotomy holds in bilingual children as well, we reinforce the claims of the SSH. Section 3 will report previously unobserved differences in the development of participial constructions in monolingual German and Italian. Our quantitative analysis of a bilingual child exhibits the same differences with regard to frequency and types of participial constructions used in these two languages, and by this we provide additional novel evidence for the SSH.

We propose that the two phenomena should be attributed to a deficient Agreement and we provide an explanation for why Agreement is more difficult to acquire than other functional categories. The claim is that functional categories fall into two classes according to the place where they are assigned a particular value; whereas with Tense, Aspect or Mood, this value is assigned in the Lexicon and imported as such in the Numeration, Agreement is syntax-filtered, encoding a relation between items whose phifeatures have to match. Syntax-filtered morphology requires a heavier computational load. Children cope with functional categories differently, with the degree of computational complexity involved in Merge/Match playing a crucial part. Our conclusion goes along trodden paths. That children have problems with Agreement is a hypothesis which was put forth in other studies (Clahsen, Eisenbeiss & Penke 1994, Plunkett 2002, among others).",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.244.19avr,Romance Linguistics: Theory and Acquisition,,978-90-272-4756-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2003933238&site=ehost-live,2003,11/7/19 17:56,11/7/19 18:42,247-262,247,262,15,"viii, 388",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 244,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,5,"<p>Accession Number: 2003933238.

Section 3 presents the general background, namely the features and properties of clitics in Romance as well as their derivation in a minimalist framework. Section 4 introduces Ritter & Rosen (2001) and shows how the facts they discuss are related to the facts in the dialect reported here. In section 5, I discuss the feature matrix of a deficient ça and show how its different properties are clearly distinct from the properties of definite or specific clitics. In general French clitics check their features irrespective of the event type on the verb. Moreover, it is demonstrated that ça lacks structural Case. It behaves differently with respect to Topicalization, Right-Dislocation and Complex Inversion facts. Section 6 concludes briefly. I have here argued through the study of a clitic or weak DP ça in French, a form which can be correlated with the countability of nominals and events, that there can also be splits in the interpretive values of French object clitics.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.244.17vin,Romance Linguistics: Theory and Acquisition,,978-90-272-4756-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2003933237&site=ehost-live,2003,11/7/19 17:56,11/7/19 18:47,223-244,223,244,21,"viii, 388",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 244,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,2,"<p>Accession Number: 2003933237.

It will be shown that the segmental phonology discussed in later sections cannot be understood without reference to prosody.

It was pointed out that in non-standard varieties of BP the subjunctive vs. indicative morphological distinction is neutralized, giving rise to an alternative strategy for encoding Irrealis modality, namely the parainfmitive constructions. It was pointed out that the absence of (embedded) AUX/Verb-subject inversion in BP banning lexical subjects licensed by inflected infinitives in epistemic contexts affects the grammatical encoding mood distinctions. It was then proposed that para in  is a dedicated particle encoding Irrealis modality in the complementation system of BP. It was finally shown that merge of para in C meets the structural condition for the subject to be licensed within the CP domain, depending on the inflectional properties of the embedded infinitive: if the infinitive is inflected, then DP is licensed within the TP domain, being assigned nominative Case; if it is non-inflected, then the DP is assigned oblique Case by para in C, which is in turn made possible by the fact that para is a dative Case assigner in BP. These results corroborate the assumptions of the Principles and Parameters framework, according to which crosslinguistic variation is encoded in the properties of functional heads. The differences in the complementation system of BP and EP were accounted for in terms of the interaction between word order and morphological properties of the verbal system affecting the grammatical encoding of mood distinctions in the functional head C.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.244.15mor,Romance Linguistics: Theory and Acquisition,,978-90-272-4756-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2003933235&site=ehost-live,2003,11/7/19 17:56,11/7/19 18:46,197-208,197,208,11,"viii, 388",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 244,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,8,"<p>Accession Number: 2003933235.

In this article, we will concentrate on VS in main clauses after preposed adverbs (AdvVS), as in (1-2). Two questions need to be answered: (a) Which types of adverbs combine with VS in main clauses in French and which do not? and (b) Given that SV is also allowed in this context, which are the structural differences between VS and SV? With respect to question (a), we will first present new empirical data concerning the distribution of different types of adverbs in VS (2.). Then, we will argue that the notion of topicality does not account for the full range of empirical data (3.), and in section 4, we will demonstrate that only stage topics allow VS in non-interrogative main clauses in French. With respect to question (b), we will show that the position of the verb is the same in VS as in SV (5.1) and that the inverted word order is only due to the different position of the subject (5.2).",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.244.14lah,Romance Linguistics: Theory and Acquisition,,978-90-272-4756-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2003933234&site=ehost-live,2003,11/7/19 17:56,11/7/19 18:46,181-196,181,196,15,"viii, 388",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 244,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,4,"<p>Accession Number: 2003933234.

The main point of the paper concerns narrative sequences of events. Examples in the habitual (e.g. (1)) are discussed from this point of view, but the semantics of habituais will not be discussed in detail. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, I provide background information on the interpretation of events and states in a narrative discourse. Then, I explain the problems that (la) and (2a) pose for current accounts of the imparfait, and, in section 5, I propose to treat the imparfait as introducing a predication on a temporal referent of discourse. To summarize, I have shown that sentences in the imparfait may denote bounded events and that such bounded events give rise to a sequential, narrative, interpretation. I have proposed that this follows if eventualities in the imparfait are introduced in a subordinate discourse structure interpreted as characterizing a temporal discourse referent. The sequential interpretation follows from the narrative rhetorical rule applying within the substructure. Because this sequence of events is embedded in a subordinate structure, the sentence as a whole doesn't function as a narrative clause, and it doesn't move the story line forward.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.244.13lab,Romance Linguistics: Theory and Acquisition,,978-90-272-4756-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2003933233&site=ehost-live,2003,11/7/19 17:56,11/7/19 18:45,165-180,165,180,15,"viii, 388",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 244,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,7,"<p>Accession Number: 2003933233.

Sections 2 to 4 show the workings of a NONINITIAL constraint resulting in a residual Tobler-Mussafia effect. Section 5 outlines a syntactic analysis deriving most of the facts from the possibility of V movement to the left of clitics. We have shown that the variation observed by Cummins & Roberge (1994) in clitic position in various French dialects receives a coherent account if seen from a diachronic perspective. We have then argued that a constraint approach to clitic placement (in interaction with changes in syntactic structure across time) accounts neatly for the facts and sheds some light on them, while this is not the case for a morphological tempate account. Work on many languages and on language change points to strong connections between phrase structure and clitic placement. The syntactic account sketched at the end of the paper explains most of the facts and takes into account clausal organisation and the special role of the various heads within the split-CP layer.

In this paper, we will extend our study to operators of the form de + Quantifier + formas/maneras/modos ' of + Quantifier + form/manner/way', e.g. de todas maneras/formas, de todos modos; de alguna manera/forma, de algún modo; de ninguna manera/forma, de ningún modo. In all of these we have an initial prepositional element (de) followed by a determiner and a plural noun indicating manner. We will show that determiner variation is significant and triggers quantificational variability. We will also defend the claim that these operators should be treated as adverbs of quantification (Lewis 1975; Heim 1982) with a systematic contrasting behavior at the syntax/semantics interface.

ATRIZFI7,journalArticle,2003,"Cuervo, María Cristina","Cuervo, María Cristina",,,,,,A Control-vs-Raising Theory of Dative Experiencers,A Control-vs-raising Theory Of Dative Experiencers,"This article presents an analysis of Romance seem+experiencer constructions in terms of control structures. The cross-linguistic behaviour of seem +experiencer is shown to correlate with two properties of the language: the availability of dative subjects and ECM. It is argued that in Spanish and Italian, the predicates formed by, respectively, parecer and sembrare and a dative experiencer argument select for a control infinitival complement clause, and not for a raising clause. In these languages, as in Icelandic, the dative experiencer DP is the thematic subject of the predicate, it is the higher argument and it moves to subject position (Specifier of matrix TP). As happens with other Romance epistemic predicates with a subject, such as creer/credere, parecer +experiencer can take an infinitival complement clause of the control type, but not a raising, ECM-type clause. This approach can straightforwardly derive the differences and, most importantly, the similarities between Romance and Icelandic, for which previous analyses had proposed independent mechanisms or arbitrary variation. The control analysis can also naturally account for the unavailability of Romance reflexives in seem+experiencer constructions. This article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents an overview of the relevant data previous research deals with, and highlights some problems. Old and new data from Romance are presented that cannot be straightforwardly accounted for within a raising analysis of seem+experiencer. Sections 3 and 4, on the structure of dative subjects and epistemic verbs respectively, set the basis for the analysis of Romance seem+experiencer constructions. The proposal is developed in Section 5, where it is shown that availability of dative subjects and the contrast between raising and control is at the core of crosslinguistic variation. The analysis is extended, in Section 6, to account for the unavailability of reflexives in seem+experiencer constructions. Section 7 briefly discusses some data that fall outside the main proposal and that require further research. Some suggestions on how to account for these data are introduced. Finally, Section 8 presents the conclusions.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.244.10cue,Romance Linguistics: Theory and Acquisition,,978-90-272-4756-8 (Eur.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2003933230&site=ehost-live,2003,11/7/19 17:56,11/7/19 18:44,111-130,111,130,19,"viii, 388",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 244,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,15,"<p>Accession Number: 2003933230.

However, we will argue that their proposal must be modified in order to consider that (at least some) weak forms are heads, and not maximal projections. This modification will permit accounting for the head behavior of adverbs, and for the differences between possessives in Italian and European Portuguese. The organization of the paper is as follows. section 2, we review Cardinaletti & Starke (1999)'s and Cardinaletti (1998)'s proposals regarding the typology of pronominal and possessive forms. Section 3 compares the Italian data on possessives with the relevant data from the possessive system in European Portuguese, spelling out the differences found in the behavior of prenommai possessives, and showing that the latter display a behavior typical of heads. Section 4 studies the behavior of some adverbs in European Portuguese that also display a head behavior.

This operation changes the feature specification of a marked configuration into their opposite ([-aF, -bG]), therefore [+high, -ATR] →[-high,+ATR]. I have proposed a theoretical explanation for some aspect of the historical evolution of the Latin vowel system. In concluding it, I would like to stress the importance of re-examining linguistic history in the light of the ever evolving linguistic theory, and to propose explanations of historical facts using current frameworks. The validity of such explanations, as in all sciences, is in their ability to reduce the phenomena under analysis to other known phenomena and to extend the proposed explanations to other independent facts.

It does so by appealing to speakers' need to maximize meaningful contrasts while minimizing differences between allophoncs of the same cohort. The OT approach thus seems more in line with intuitions concerning language use in general: language production is viewed as a direct leap from mental representations to output. AS speakers maintain an underlying distinction between /I/ and /I^N/ at the surface, with minimal pairs such as hiena [ʝ e.na] ~ llena [ Ӡ e.na] and hierba ~ yerba (see (6)) reinforcing the idea of a phonemic distinction. Orthography exerts considerable influence on vocoid fortition, with spelling pronunciations reflected in systematically differential treatment of hi- and y- (or ll -), and in vacillation over such items as secuoia/secuoya 'sequoya', whose variant spellings occasioned doubts on the part of some informants.

In this paper we re-examine expletives in Old (OF) and Modern French (MF), languages that differ parametrically with respect to the distribution of expletives and Case agreement. We begin our discussion by examining the contrasting distribution of expletives in the two languages, focusing largely on subject-verb agreement patterns and Case assignment. After reviewing the previous analysis of Arteaga (1994), we present the relevant theoretical assumptions under the Minimalist Program. Finally, we give our analysis of expletive constructions in OF and MF. We propose that neuter il merges at CP only to satisfy the EPP of C. In this paper we have argued that the distribution of OF expletives and agreement with associates are a function of the parametric settings of T and C. The loss of nominal and verbal inflection led to the loss of V2 and null subjects in MF. Our analysis is preferable to earlier treatments in the GB framework because it motivates the uninterpretable features of Case, EPP , and Agr, and it relates them to their interpretable counterparts. We have argued that the richness of overt morphology determines the availability of uninterpretable features, and thus we derive the syntax directly from the morphology of the language.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.258.01art,Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics,1-58811-598-4,,,,2004,11/7/19 19:04,11/7/19 19:06,1-15,1,15,14,,258,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,4,"<p>33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN, APR 24-27, 2003</p>",book article,,,"Auger, J and Clements, JC and Vance, B",LSRL33,Indiana University,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages
GLB4TJE4,conferencePaper,2004,"Burzio, L","Burzio, L",,,,,,Paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations in Italian verbal inflection,Paradigmatic And Syntagmatic Relations In Italian Verbal Inflection,"I have argued that in Italian verbal inflection lexicon, phonology, and morphology can interact in very fine-grained ways. While phonology and morphology give rise to ‘syntagmatic’ effects— surface allomorphs being conditioned by their immediate environments— such effects are under some lexical control. Yet the lexicon proves insufficient by itself, as much of the distribution is correctly captured only in syntagmatic terms. In the extended OT framework that incorporates the representational entailments hypothesis, such interactions result from entailment summation: While either grammatical or lexical entailments may be insufficient individually, they may nonetheless be sufficient when they join forces. Entailment summation is the basis not only for such conjunctive effects, but also for constraint ranking in OT more generally. We have seen that with large classes PU effects overwhelm lexical effects, thus blocking any alternation that has a lexical basis. This is because, with larger classes, entailment summation yields larger totals. P&B are correct in highlighting the role of paradigmatic relations, but fail to factor in the phonology responsible for many of the syntagmatic ones. In addition, their use of coindexation to express the paradigmatic relations is out of character with their violable nature, correctly expressed by OT constraints and their underlying entailments.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.258.02bur,Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics,1-58811-598-4,,,,2004,11/7/19 19:04,11/7/19 19:06,17-44,17,44,27,,258,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,9,"<p>33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN, APR 24-27, 2003</p>",book article,,,"Auger, J and Clements, JC and Vance, B",LSRL33,Indiana University,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

We focus on the phenomenon known as overgeneralization of causatives (* Peter laughed the girl. “Peter caused the girl to laugh.” / * Peter arrived the girl at school late. “Peter caused the girl to arrive at school late.”). Our findings suggest that L2 learners make use of different aspects of their L1 knowledge at different levels of proficiency. We propose that nonadvanced learners tend to focus on the L1 constructional properties of causatives, whereas advanced learners focus on L1 specific lexical properties of verb classes. The chapter is organized as follows. In section 1, we discuss the properties of lexical causatives in English and Spanish. In section 2, previous studies on the L2 acquisition of causatives are briefly reviewed. In section 3, we present our study (hypothesis, predictions, experimental design, and group results). In section 4, the group results are discussed, and an account is proposed.

I have also clarified the difference between what was termed a ‘strict’ inchoative reading and a reading that reflects a change of state (though not necessarily the onset of the new state). My examination highlighted the fact that, based on available data, there is a highly important difference in how the atelicity of the imperfecto affects the aktionsart of its clause in different environments, viz. mass-/count-NP objects, terminal locative PPs, and temporal adverbials. I also explored the notion of coercion as handled by de Swart (1998, 2000) and Bonami (2002), and concluded that, as far I have been able to ascertain, such a process is only justifiable for the special telic reading of the imperfecto arising in combination with en una hora -type adverbials.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.258.04cip,Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics,1-58811-598-4,,,,2004,11/7/19 19:04,11/7/19 19:07,65-81,65,81,16,,258,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,2,"<p>33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN, APR 24-27, 2003</p>",book article,,,"Auger, J and Clements, JC and Vance, B",LSRL33,Indiana University,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

Comments about the similarities between palatal laterals and glides can be found in the literature on Spanish phonology (Lipski 1989) and dialectology (Quilis 1993), and also in studies on other Romance languages (Silva 1999). Phonological accounts of the change have been proposed within autosegmental (Lipski) and Optimality Theory (Colantoni 2001). In spite of their formal differences, both accounts assume that the result of the change is the emergence of a different segment. I show here that the glide was indeed present before the change occurred in the CV transition. I argue, in particular, that this change could be interpreted in the spirit of Ohala’s (1989) hidden variation theory, which claims that synchronic variation is a precondition for sound change. Sound change takes place when the listener, in the acquisition process, reinterprets the acoustic cues that are already present in the signal; that is, a secondary cue becomes the relevant cue to parse the segment. In the specific case of Argentine Spanish, a factor that is already present in the signal, namely, the glide-like CV transition, would be interpreted by the listener as the relevant cue of the segment, motivating the substitution of [ ʎ ] by the glide.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.258.05col,Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics,1-58811-598-4,,,,2004,11/7/19 19:04,11/7/19 19:08,83-102,83,102,19,,258,,,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science Series IV-Current Issues in Linguistic Theory,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,2,"<p>33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN, APR 24-27, 2003</p>",book article,,,"Auger, J and Clements, JC and Vance, B",LSRL33,Indiana University,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

All solutions proposed to date (onset or coda affiliation) are costly from a phonological point of view as they run counter to wellattested principles of phonological theory, such as Structure Preservation (Kaisse & Shaw 1985; Kiparksy 1985; Mohanan 1986) and syllabicmarkedness generalizations (*VC.V). In this chapter, I argue that an analysis based on an underlying velar nasal does not encounter any of the difficulties of previous accounts. Consideration of historical and cross-linguistic facts as part of an OT account offers additional support for the underlying nature of the velar and sheds light on aspects of the grammars of related languages like Portuguese and Gascon. The chapter is organized as follows: after the presentation of the data (section 1) and a brief summary of previous accounts (section 2), the proposal and its advantages are introduced in general terms in 3.1; in 3.2 a detailed optimality-theoretic analysis of diachronic and synchronic facts is presented. The underlying velars are motivated also in that section.

CLT587S4,conferencePaper,2004,"Cummins, S; Roberge, Y","Cummins, S"," Roberge, Y",,,,,Null objects in French and English,Null Objects In French And English,"We have argued that the existence of null objects is largely determined by the TR and that cross-linguistic variation is therefore predicted to occur mostly in the recoverability mechanisms particular grammars use. A comparison of English and French null objects, drawing on corpus data, was used to support this claim. The data from these two languages lead to the conclusion that there are three types of null objects: 1. Bound: a bound variable or a null constant 2. Discourse-linked: a null pronominal 3. Internally licensed: null cognate objects (predicted by the TR), a bare N It was shown that French and English differ only in the availability of discourse-linked null objects and bound definite null objects (see (35) and (36) for a summary). We have characterized the French discourse-linked null object as a clitic-drop construction. This preliminary account is intended to sketch out the semantic and syntactic characteristics of the three types of null objects, and the role pragmatic principles play in their recovery. Under the TR, all null objects are syntactically represented; ensuring syntactic representation allows for an account of differences in referentiality and syntactic activity.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.258.07cum,Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics,1-58811-598-4,,,,2004,11/7/19 19:04,11/7/19 19:08,121-138,121,138,17,,258,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,16,"<p>33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN, APR 24-27, 2003</p>",book article,,,"Auger, J and Clements, JC and Vance, B",LSRL33,Indiana University,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages
JTVWM2XA,conferencePaper,2004,"Deprez, V; Martineau, F","Deprez, V"," Martineau, F",,,,,Micro-parametric variation and negative concord,Micro-parametric Variation And Negative Concord,"The chapter is structured as follows. First, arguments supporting the central thesis of Déprez (2000) are summarized, based on an empirical comparison of two extremely diverging cases of NC, SF and Martinique Creole. Although using virtually identical N-words, the two languages have strikingly distinct NC properties. Following Déprez (1999, 2000), these NC properties can be explained by the distinct structural nature of their N-words. Second, the proposed structural distinction is further put to the test with the study of Modern QF NC, which presents mixed properties with respect to SF and Martinique Creole. The final test offered is that of time, with a study of the diachronic evolution of aucun. This chapter presented a comparative landscape of the NC properties in a variety of francophone dialects and historical states and has proposed an analysis that relies on the internal structure of N-words to account for the observed diversity. Two structures have been proposed: (13a) locates the N- word in a quantificational determiner-like position and (13b) assumes, on the contrary, that the N-word is dominated by a null determiner. Distinct semantic properties are associated with each structure and movement internal to the nominal structure of N-words could account for the variations observed synchronically and diachronically among the distinct dialects. A more detailed study of the syntactic properties of N-words would be useful to better support the suggested analysis, but we hope to have provided sufficient evidence to establish the value of our proposed approach.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.258.08dep,Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics,1-58811-598-4,,,,2004,11/7/19 19:04,11/7/19 19:09,139-158,139,158,19,,258,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,19,"<p>33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN, APR 24-27, 2003</p>",book article,,,"Auger, J and Clements, JC and Vance, B",LSRL33,Indiana University,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

6XZS26UI,conferencePaper,2004,"Feldstein, RF","Feldstein, RF",,,,,,On the structure of syncretism in Romanian conjugation,On The Structure Of Syncretism In Romanian Conjugation,"This chapter has attempted to demonstrate some of the complexities and systematic properties of Romanian conjugational syncretism, particularly when it is phonologically conditioned in the present tense. Two recent linguistic discussions of Romanian syncretism were shown to contain inaccuracies, due to the fact that they follow the traditional view of linking syncretism to conjugational class. It was demonstrated that one cannot accurately deal with syncretism in terms of the traditional conjugational types. Phonologically conditioned syncretism, as found in the Romanian present tense, is structurally very different from the nonphonological type, as found in the imperfect. As an alternative to the traditional conjugational types, a new morphophonemic system was proposed in which verb stems, including the theme vowel, all cyclically combine with a tripartite desinential complex. As shown, this system is capable of generating the correct syncretic forms and can help to explain how syncretism arises in the structure of the language. Thus, this chapter has indicated the inadequacies of previous analyses and suggested a systematic alternative for the analysis of Romanian syncretism. Finally, a surface-oriented analysis of syncretism was explored, which might serve to complement the analysis of underlying forms. Both the underlying morphophonemic forms and the surface forms constitute a complex structure that has yet to be fully understood in all of its ramifications.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.258.10fel,Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics,1-58811-598-4,,,,2004,11/7/19 19:04,11/7/19 19:04,177-195,177,195,18,,258,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,0,"<p>33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN, APR 24-27, 2003</p>",book article,,,"Auger, J and Clements, JC and Vance, B",LSRL33,Indiana University,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages
I5KSDNRJ,conferencePaper,2004,"Hoyt, F; Teodorescu, A","Hoyt, F"," Teodorescu, A",,,,,Sluicing in Romanian - A typological study,Sluicing In Romanian - A Typological Study,"We find that, despite the superficial similarities between Romanian and Japanese sluicing, an S-ellipsis analysis of Romanian sluicing as in (6a) is to be preferred. We show that the similarities between Romanian and Japanese sluicing are epiphenomenal and follow from independent syntactic properties of the two languages. An S-ellipsis analysis immediately accounts for the key properties of Romanian sluicing. The differences between Romanian and English sluicing follow from the presence of a richer structure in the left periphery of embedded clauses in Romanian. A terminological note is in order. We use the term ‘sluicing’ exclusively as a cross-linguistic descriptive label for ellipsis of subconstituents of an embedded question. This has subcategories such as English Sluicing, Romanian Sluicing, and Japanese Sluicing. As we use it, sluicing implies nothing about the structural analyses of the data. Instead, analyses are referred to as different kinds of ‘ellipsis’: English and Romanian sluices are both subclasses of S-ellipsis, while Japanese sluicing is a class of CP-ellipsis. The chapter is organized as follows: In section 1, we discuss the superficial similarities between Romanian and Japanese sluicing, and how these similarities contrast with English sluicing. In section 2, we discuss the crucial similarity between English and Romanian sluicing: island insensitivity. In section 3 we compare possible analyses for Romanian sluicing and conclude that an S-ellipsis analysis is the only option, providing evidence that supports such an analysis.

In section 1, I discuss some common Romance patterns that have been pointed out in the literature or that emerge from the comparison of studies on various Romance languages. In section 2, I extend the comparison to Occitan, a Romance language that has been neglected in intonational studies but that seems to me very important for the comparative and diachronic study of Romance intonation because, geographically, Occitan forms a link between French, the most innovative Romance language in prosodic matters, and both Ibero-Romance and Italo-Romance (on Occitan prosody cf. Meisenburg 2001). The study of intonation has become a very active area of research in recent years. As our knowledge of the intonational details of the Romance languages increases, it seems sensible to start to consider whether the facts can be examined from a comparative and diachronic perspective. Historical ‘intonology’ presents specific challenges, as I have noted, but, with all necessary caveats in mind, progress in this area does not seem entirely out of the question. In this chapter I have also explored some basic features of the intonational system of Occitan, a key language for these purposes, from a panRomance point of view, going somewhat beyond what I was able to advance in Hualde (2003).",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.258.12hua,Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics,1-58811-598-4,,,,2004,11/7/19 19:04,11/7/19 19:09,217-237,217,237,20,,258,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,3,"<p>33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN, APR 24-27, 2003</p>",book article,,,"Auger, J and Clements, JC and Vance, B",LSRL33,Indiana University,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages
65BTRQRJ,conferencePaper,2004,"Kempchinsky, P","Kempchinsky, P",,,,,,Romance SE as an aspectual element,Romance Se As An Aspectual Element,"I propose that SE is primarily an aspectual element that either links to, introduces, or absorbs a temporal subevent. In some constructions, this will be E2, so that SE may be interpreted as telic; however, to say that SE is an aspectual element is not to say that SE is necessarily always a marker of telicity. In some cases, the linking of SE to a temporal subevent will result in a reduction of valency because SE will thus deprive an argument of a temporal subevent to link to; in other cases, SE will actually add event structure. The specific ways in which SE interacts with event structure will yield as a consequence the variety of syntactic constructions in which it is found. My goal here is to defend this analysis of SE in relative detail for two manifestations of SE: reflexive SE and ergative or inchoative SE. In other work (Kempchinsky 2003) I extend the analysis to middle SE and passive SE. The chapter is organized as follows. In section 1, I present my working assumptions on the morphosyntactic nature of the morpheme SE and outline in greater detail the aspectual framework. In section 2, I present the analysis of reflexive SE, and in section 3 the analysis of ergative/inchoative SE, focusing in particular in section 3.2 on the nature of the upper Event Phrase.

QBAB4ZE7,conferencePaper,2004,"Lief, E","Lief, E",,,,,,Proto-romance *[w] and the velar preterites,Proto-romance *[w] And The Velar Preterites,"In contrast to the traditional approach, I argue that both sound change (specifically, the development bw > gw ) and analogy (with the verb “have”) have worked together to create such velar preterites. In the first part of this chapter, I show that there is no support for w > gw outside of these verb forms. I then reformulate the original sound change (i.e., bw > gw ) and propose a mechanism for its analogical extension throughout the Old Occitan and Catalan past-tense systems. The high token frequency of the verb HABUI “have,” which underwent the sound change, is one factor that favored the extension of this velar throughout other verbal paradigms. Finally, to demonstrate the likelihood of analogy with “have,” I examine Spanish and Portuguese perfects where the influence of “have” is unequivocal. Throughout this chapter, I have shown that the putative sound change w > gw in Occitan and Catalan is ruled out on several grounds. First, there are simply no instances of any general w > gw outside of these past-tense forms. Here, the only apparent examples of w > gw are of the type nw > ŋgw , occurring with the greatest frequency in Spanish and Portuguese.

I will illustrate this issue by reviewing the behavior of the inflected forms of insular Catalan with respect to vowel insertion. ‘Insular Catalan’ refers to the varieties spoken in the Sardinian town of Alguer (Italy) and in the Balearic Islands. The contrast between nouns and verbs, typical of insular Catalan as far as epenthesis is concerned, is not an odd idiosyncrasy of 1 S . PR . IND , but is related to other peculiar contrasts between nouns and verbs that the language shows. The OP model succeeds in grasping these differences in a way that is somehow connected with differences in the organization of their paradigms. In addition to that, some preliminary results reported in McCarthy (2001) are fully supported by the data presented in this chapter, namely, the impossibility of true underapplication within paradigms and the possibility of OP unfaithfulness for markedness reasons. This analysis further provides a novel type of evidence for the OP model: dialectal variation due to the reranking of OP constraints.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.258.15llo,Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics,1-58811-598-4,,,,2004,11/7/19 19:04,11/7/19 19:09,275-297,275,297,22,,258,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,6,"<p>33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN, APR 24-27, 2003</p>",book article,,,"Auger, J and Clements, JC and Vance, B",LSRL33,Indiana University,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

It was suggested, first, that the only hypothesis consistent with the data is one in which both velars are derived from a single underlying segment. A standard rule-based approach to geada has been shown to be untenable, because the lexical rule needed to derive the [x] ∼ [g] complementary distribution inevitably leads to a violation of the principle of Structure Preservation. The geada data have also been shown to pose a significant challenge to a constraint-based analysis, as in the OT model. After considering each of the two allophonic realizations in (quasi-)complementary distribution as basic, it was concluded that the only viable alternative is one that posits /x/ and derives [g] in postnasal position inside morphemes. This solution, however, is available only if we appeal to the conjunction of a markedness constraint with a faithfulness one (to *NC  & IDENT -[cont]), a formal complexity that, I have argued, is required to match the asymmetric nature of constraints on voicing and continuancy for postnasal obstruents in geada Galician: Agreement in this feature applies to velars, not to other places of articulation.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.258.16mar,Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics,1-58811-598-4,,,,2004,11/7/19 19:04,11/7/19 19:09,299-320,299,320,21,,258,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,2,"<p>33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN, APR 24-27, 2003</p>",book article,,,"Auger, J and Clements, JC and Vance, B",LSRL33,Indiana University,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

It was found that Lima speakers and some Cusco speakers follow the trait observed in other Spanish varieties of realizing prenuclear peaks on the post-tonic syllable in open syllables within broad-focus declaratives. However, several speakers from Cusco demonstrated alignment of prenuclear peaks (subject and/or verb) within the stressed syllable. It has been suggested that the long-standing language contact situation with Quechua may have resulted in the development of these alternate intonation patterns. Other varieties of Spanish, such as Madrid Spanish, have been reported to align peaks within the stressed syllable under contrastive focus. In order to gain a fuller understanding of the intonation system employed by these Cusco speakers, it will be necessary to next ascertain how contrastive focus is realized, since these Cusco speakers already produce early prenuclear peaks under broadfocus conditions. Further analysis of Quechua intonation will likewise provide additional insight into this indigenous language and the ways it may contribute to the development of Spanish intonation as found in the Andean region.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.258.17oro,Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics,1-58811-598-4,,,,2004,11/7/19 19:04,11/7/19 19:10,321-341,321,341,20,,258,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,9,"<p>33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN, APR 24-27, 2003</p>",book article,,,"Auger, J and Clements, JC and Vance, B",LSRL33,Indiana University,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

This article investigates apparently unrelated phenomena in Italian that call for the existence of a tacit intentional predicate at the semantic level. I assume a neo-Davidsonian framework arguing that predicates contain event arguments and sentences existentially quantify over events and event complexes formed of subevents. The first piece of data, at first observed in English, considers the modification with the adverb quasi “almost,” which creates ambiguous sentences when the event described is an intentional action (section 1). I claim that the ambiguity is the effect of the following combination of factors. First, the meaning of quasi is a binary predicate true of an event and an intensional entity (property or proposition). Second, the logical form of causative sentences with an intentional subject contains a tacit intentional predicate. The third and final factor is the semantic scope of the existential operator quantifying over events and the intension operator provided by the second argument of quasi.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.258.18vec,Contemporary Approaches to Romance Linguistics,1-58811-598-4,,,,2004,11/7/19 19:04,11/7/19 19:10,343-360,343,360,17,,258,,,AMSTERDAM STUDIES IN THE THEORY AND HISTORY OF LINGUISTIC SCIENCE : SERIES IV - CURRENT ISSUES IN LINGUISTIC THEORY,JOHN BENJAMINS B V PUBL,"PO BOX 36224, 1020 AMSTERDAM ME, NETHERLANDS",English,,,1,"<p>33rd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Indiana Univ, Bloomington, IN, APR 24-27, 2003</p>",book article,,,"Auger, J and Clements, JC and Vance, B",LSRL33,Indiana University,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages
F8ZCEQEA,conferencePaper,2004,"Vicente, L","Vicente, L",,,,,,"Inversion, reconstruction, and the structure of relative clauses","Inversion, Reconstruction, And The Structure Of Relative Clauses","The goal of this chapter is to argue in favor of a double-headed analysis of restrictive relative clauses (Platero 1974; Sauerland 1998, 2000). One of the head positions is the SpecCP slot of the relative clause, while the other is the NP the relative clause is adjoined to. Contra Platero and Sauerland, I argue that there is only one head position, the other one being taken up by an empty, expletive-like element that I dub ‘ eNP .’ I also argue for Sauerland’s and Aoun and Li’s (2003) hypothesis that both the matching and the raising analyses are made available by UG. However, whereas they assume that each analysis involves a different syntactic structure, I argue that there is only one structure, the differences between ‘raising’ and ‘matching’ arising from an indeterminacy on the way in which the ‘real’ relative head and eNP are merged. Moreover, this indeterminacy is also shown to be responsible for certain reconstruction asymmetries in Spanish relative clauses that had not been noticed so far. The article is organized as follows. In section 1, I introduce the relevant data set from Spanish and compare it to its English counterpart. Section 2 consists of a brief review of the double-headed analysis of relative clauses, and the modifications I introduce. In section 3, I take a brief excursus so as to link the variations in word order within relative clauses to variations in word order in other parts of the language. In section 4, I return to the asymmetries introduced in section 1, and show how they can be accounted for in terms of the theory developed so far.

That is, for these data, priming does not persist over large chunks of discourse; it comes into play immediately or is greatly weakened.

58ZX4LG7,journalArticle,2005,"Tortora, Christina","Tortora, Christina",,,,,,The Preposition's Preposition in Italian: Evidence for Boundedness of Space,The Preposition's Preposition In Italian: Evidence For Boundedness Of Space,"In this paper I have discussed a previously unexplored pattern regarding Italian PPs that contain an adverbial preposition with an optional grammatical preposition a. The interpretive facts led me to conclude that the presence of a is the reflex of the unspecified feature [bounded] within the adverbial preposition’s functional structure, pointing to the more general conclusion that grammatical prepositions do not head PPs at all, but rather only serve to instantiate functional heads (cf. Kayne 1999; and as we have seen, support for this hypothesis is provided by the behavior of control verbs such as convincere, where choice of the grammatical P determines the temporal interpretation of the embedded infinitive). The Portuguese data additionally suggest that the idea that a is merged to the left of the adverbial preposition may indeed be correct. Of course, further investigation of the semantic and syntactic patterns with adverbial a -postpositions and a -less adverbial prepositions in Spanish and Portuguese is necessary, but the preliminary review provided above seems promising as support for the direction proposed in this paper. Needless to say, the proposal in this paper does raise many questions that have been left unanswered. In addition to that regarding the Spanish/Portuguese postpositions, there is the question of how adverbial prepositions that obligatorily occur with di / de in Italian, Spanish, and French are to be analyzed under this framework. Likewise, what is the semantic behavior of the adverbial prepositions in (7) that we have not discussed? And what is the nature of those in (6), which obligatorily appear with a ? I believe that the approach offered in this paper promises to lead to a unified understanding of all of these cases. Last but not least, a fundamental contribution of this paper which does not depend on the formal analysis provided in 4.1 is the idea that space is grammatically treated like entities and events in terms of the concept of boundedness. “Space” is taken to consist of two types, PATH and PLACE (following Jackendoff 1983), and evidence that non-temporal paths are bounded is taken as support for the idea that places (which are non-temporal) are treated in the same way.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.272.19tor,Theoretical and Experimental Approaches to Romance Linguistics,,978-90-272-4786-5,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006930678&site=ehost-live,2005,11/7/19 19:23,11/7/19 19:28,307-327,307,327,20,"viii, 367",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 272,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,29,"<p>Accession Number: 2006930678.

Overall results in this paper have shown that post-lexical and lexical geminates are phonetically the same in Sienese Italian, in line with Ladd & Scobbie’s conclusions (2003) for Sardinian. While the acoustic appearance of RS geminates varies considerably in naturally occurring speech, WM geminates show a similar degree of phonetic variation.

Section 2 is essentially a description of the types of null objects found in contemporary French and includes a discussion of the implications of this typology for L1 French. In Section 3, we look at null objects from an L1 acquisition perspective, including previous work on the topic. Section 4 is a discussion of some of the conclusions to be drawn from our observations. More specifically, this study leads to the following general conclusions: 

1) Variation among adult native speakers regarding the illicit and licit use of null objects should make us very cautious in setting firm boundaries between licit and illicit null objects in child language; 

2)The two methods generally used to determine whether null objects are licit or illicit, i.e. adult judgments and lexical transitivity, are not reliable. 

3) A detailed typology of the null objects found in adult French must serve as the basis for comparing child and adult uses of null objects. The data involved is such that an experimental setting may be the only way to control for the variables involved.

In this article we have proposed that a detailed adult grammar, including all observed variation, is the starting point for the study of the phenomenon of object omission in child language. On the basis of this adult grammar, we questioned the use of the notion of “obligatory context” as applied to object omission in spontaneous child speech. While this notion is helpful for omissions of clear grammatical elements (verbal inflections, determiners, subject clitics) required independently of variables such as the context of utterance, the range of object omission constructions found in adult speech, including the omission of clitics, cast doubts on its usefulness. Moreover, adult judgments are also quite variable and, we hoped to have shown, not empirically reliable. Questions remain about the nature of object omission and the explanation for the phenomena but we have proposed that the differences observed between French child and adult utterances may not involve different grammars of null objects but may be attributable to other independent factors, such as the development of object clitics.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.272.13pir,Theoretical and Experimental Approaches to Romance Linguistics,,978-90-272-4786-5,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006930672&site=ehost-live,2005,11/7/19 19:23,11/7/19 19:26,197-212,197,212,15,"viii, 367",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 272,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,20,"<p>Accession Number: 2006930672.

This examination of phonetic correlates will be couched in a proposal to consider latent final consonants moraic, as already suggested by Scullen (1997). Our prosodic analysis follows an AM model of intonation (Jun and Fougeron 2000, 2002), assuming a tonally rather than syntactically-derived hierarchy of prosodic constituents. In this study, we have demonstrated that moraic theory manages to explain simple cases of Liaison as well as complex ones, such as Liaison sans enchaînement , by positing that latent Liaison consonants are not dominated by a mora, and are therefore extrametrical. These realizations show the presence of a schwa-like vowel which provides the extra mora of the syllable formed by the unlinked Liaison consonant. Independent evidence from sociophonetic studies on such vowels supports this hypothesis. Through the prosodic analyses of what we have called special cases of Liaison, we also have raised the issue of the prosodic domain of Liaison, and have shown phonetic evidence that Liaison consonants may be stopped by or may go through major prosodic boundaries within the same speech style. This suggests that the prosodic domain of Liaison, all styles and realizations taken together, cannot be restricted to the AP or the PhP. But further research is needed to collect more empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.272.12mil,Theoretical and Experimental Approaches to Romance Linguistics,,978-90-272-4786-5,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006930671&site=ehost-live,2005,11/7/19 19:23,11/7/19 19:26,179-196,179,196,17,"viii, 367",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 272,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,7,"<p>Accession Number: 2006930671.

T6K5RAF4,journalArticle,2005,"Marin, Stefania","Marin, Stefania",,,,,,Complex Nuclei in Articulatory Phonology: The Case of Romanian Diphthongs,Complex Nuclei In Articulatory Phonology: The Case Of Romanian Diphthongs,"This paper examines complex nuclei, as an instance of syllable complexity, taking as a concrete example the Romanian phonological diphthong /ea/. My goal will be both to propose a theoretical Articulatory Phonology analysis of complex nucleus effects and to provide experimental evidence that such a proposal is warranted and preferable to existing analyses. In this paper I proposed an Articulatory Phonology analysis of the Romanian diphthong ea , suggesting that it should be represented as two vowels coupled synchronously. The empirical advantage of the proposal is that it accounts for the results observed in the conducted experiment, results that are problematic for previously available analyses. Specifically, the proposed AP analysis is able to predict and explain the observed acoustic difference between non-alternating e and e alternating with the diphthong ea . The proposed representation of the diphthong predicts recoverability of its components under certain conditions and a blending of its components under other conditions, and it is this blending that causes the reported acoustic difference between alternating/ blended e and non-alternating e. The theoretical advantage of the proposal is that it does away with any need for syllable hierarchy to derive complex nucleus effects. Complex nucleus effects (like other syllable effects, previously studied, cf. Browman and Goldstein 1995a-b, 2000) can be explained by a specific pattern of gestural organization – synchronous coupling, and by lawful consequences predicted by such coupling. On a larger scale, this proposal addresses the century-old notion of syllables and what syllables are, and adding to work done on (complex) onset and coda effects, it comes to complete, from the complex nucleus effects perspective, the hypothesis that what defines syllables is not an arbitrary hierarchy between segments, but rather a specific mode of coordination between gestures. An additional important advantage of the proposed analysis is that it explains complex nucleus effects in a speech production theory that needs no translation between units of representation and their execution, as opposed to other phonological theories that would need a set of arbitrary rules for phonetic implementation.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.272.11mar,Theoretical and Experimental Approaches to Romance Linguistics,,978-90-272-4786-5,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006930670&site=ehost-live,2005,11/7/19 19:23,11/7/19 19:23,161-177,161,177,16,"viii, 367",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 272,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,0,"<p>Accession Number: 2006930670.

Such an approach was taken by Walker (2000) in her analysis of affixation in Mbe. This study extends the applicability of Walker’s suggestion beyond morpheme realization. Specifically, evidence from Romanian nominal morphology is brought to bear on the necessity of considering a mechanism of morphology-phonology correspondence in outputs in the analysis of apparent phonological deletion of the definite article in Romanian masculines and neuters in casual speech. In this paper I argued for the possibility of capturing morphological variation (morpheme realization) in terms of correspondence between M(orphological) and P(honological) structure in outputs. Evidence from the behavior of Romanian masculine and neuter definites in careful and casual speech was brought to bear on the issue. M-P Correspondence introduces a new family of constraints whose activity can account for phenomena at the Morphology-Phonology interface, as the apparent deletion of the definite article in casual speech in Romanian nominals, which was used to illustrate the morphological coalescence mechanism supported by the proposal.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.272.10isc,Theoretical and Experimental Approaches to Romance Linguistics,,978-90-272-4786-5,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006930669&site=ehost-live,2005,11/7/19 19:23,11/7/19 19:26,145-159,145,159,14,"viii, 367",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 272,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,2,"<p>Accession Number: 2006930669.

I ask whether young learners of Spanish distribute grammatical aspect according to lexical aspect in their production of verbal morphology as it has been reported in other languages, and whether children are able to assess aspectual meaning from aspectual morphology. I will show that children at the age of 3-4 have difficulties understanding the entailment of completion carried out by perfective morphology in a telic verb. In addition, I will show that children at this age do not know the entailment of non-completion carried out by imperfective morphology in a telic verb even though they use these forms in their production at a very early age. It will be argued that the comprehension of the semantics of Spanish grammatical aspect does not take place until approximately the age of 5.

I present an optimality-theoretic analysis (Prince and Smolensky 1993; and subsequent references), based on output-output correspondence (Benua 1995; Burzio 1994; Kenstowicz 1996; Steriade 1996; inter alia), and argue that it provides a simple solution to the puzzles. I show that the analysis can be straightforwardly extended to cover cases of underand overapplication related to mid-vowel alternations and nasality in BP diminutives, providing thus a unified account for all the morphophonological peculiarities involving diminutives in the language. In this paper, I developed an optimality-theoretic account of the peculiar behavior of diminutives in BP with respect to plural formation and vowel alternation. Central to the analysis was the notion of output-output correspondence (Benua 1995; Burzio 1996; Kenstowicz 1996; Steriade 1996; inter alia). In particular, I made crucial use of faithfulness constraints enforcing similarity between diminutive words and their corresponding non-diminutive forms.

In doing so, we set out two goals. First, we will demonstrate that cluster-medial epenthesis is not limited to Spanish but also occurs in French, although in a more restricted set of environments. Second, following others (e.g. Malmberg 1965; Ohala 1992), we will argue that the epenthesis attested is a form of dissimilation which serves to increase the articulatory distance between the two members of the cluster. We will show that distance can be measured on the manner, place and voicing dimensions, with voicing being the most important of the three. On the manner dimension, continuancy plays a crucial role in both languages. In particular, if the two members of the cluster are [-continuant], epenthesis occurs quasi-categorically. As for place, epenthesis tends to be more frequent when both members of the cluster share place features. Finally, in French, epenthesis occurs only with clusters containing voiced obstruents; in Spanish, epenthetic vowels are significantly longer in these environments. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In §2, we outline the basic phonological and phonetic properties of French and Spanish OL clusters. We attempt to explain the epenthesis previously reported for Spanish and also attested in the current French data in the context of the dissimilation hypothesis in §3, where we forward a number of hypotheses. The experimental study used to test these hypotheses is outlined in §4, followed by the reporting of the results in §5. In §6, we evaluate each of the hypotheses, providing explanations for those cases refuted by the data.

Conversational speech was analyzed for prosodic rhythm using the Pairwise Variability Index (Low & Grabe 1995), which included for each speaker at least 200 syllable-to- syllable comparisons in each language in order to determine the actual quantitative differences between Spanish and English. Additionally, the English data were compared to the data in the Thomas and Carter (2003 a, b) corpus in order to determine the rhythmic differences between North Carolina Hispanics and the benchmark non-Spanish-speaking, native English-speaking community. Finally, the Raleigh corpus provides access to monolingual Spanish speakers whose data will be used to examine the differences in Spanish among monolingual and bilingual Spanish speakers, shedding light on possible influences of English on the Spanish of Raleigh bilinguals. As expected, initial findings show that the rhythm associated with Hispanic English is, in fact substantially more syllable-timed than the English of non-Hispanics, while the rhythm associated with the Spanish of the Raleigh bilinguals is significantly more syllable-timed than the English of either group.

Let us summarize the main findings of our study. First, the results of our experiment have demonstrated that early Romanian follows Pattern II, i.e., object clitics are not problematic for young children, being produced freely in obligatory environments. Second, we have shown that the UCC Hypothesis can explain the acquisition of Romanian object clitics. Clitic omissions shown by very young children in this language are not comparable to those observed in Pattern I languages. These omissions are not triggered by the UCC (as in Pattern I languages). Rather, they are due to production limitations, i.e., the inability of very young children to produce utterances of the length required by the clitic constructions. Although the main findings of the study are quite striking and convincing, the study does have some limitations that must be noted. Because the MLUs were calculated disregarding the experimental utterances (to make sure that the presence or absence of object clitics did not influence this measurement), for some children, MLU was calculated on rather few available independent utterances. Given that at the time of designing the experiment, we had no indication that MLUs might be a relevant factor, we did not include a separate task for collecting utterances that could be used for MLU calculation. One area of future research is going to be focused on devising a version of the experiment that could shed light on the exact nature of this production limitation, for instance, by including a subpart that would provide independent data for MLU measurement. Another direction of research that we plan to pursue is expanding the study to include the production of indirect object (dative) clitics, in addition to direct object clitics, which will allow us to further test the predictions of the UCC Hypothesis.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.272.03bab,Theoretical and Experimental Approaches to Romance Linguistics,,978-90-272-4786-5,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006930662&site=ehost-live,2005,11/7/19 19:23,11/7/19 19:25,21-40,21,40,19,"viii, 367",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 272,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,35,"<p>Accession Number: 2006930662.

(1) The boys will wash the dishes, and girls, mop the ﬂoor. This sentence is interpreted as if the determiner in the initial subject the boys were also present in the subject in the second conjunct. 

In this paper, we examine the properties of this construction in Spanish, and provide an analysis based on Johnson’s (2000) and Lin’s (2002) proposals for this construction in English. An important part of the analyses proposed by these authors is the claim that determiners are licensed in functional projections above v P (see Sportiche 1996). We adopt Lin’s (2002) version of this claim, and propose an extension to it by arguing that there are more licensing positions for determiners than originally proposed in that work. Moreover, by examining certain restrictions on word order in determiner sharing in questions, we argue that they provide evidence for the hypothesis put forth in Chomsky 1986, 2000 that wh-movement involves an intermediate step in a position between TP and VP. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the basic data and provide an analysis of determiner sharing in non-questions. In Section 3, we extend this analysis to sharing of wh-determiners, and in Section 4 we use this analysis to provide evidence for the claim that wh-movement involves an intermediate step between TP and VP.

This paper investigates the hypothesis that an analogous process of grammaticalization concerns the verb volerci “take (intr.)/be necessary” (< modal volere “want”). The main goal of the paper is then to determine whether volerci can still be considered a lexical verb or it is more accurately categorized as a functional head á la par with bisogna. A careful comparison between volerci and Modern Italian bisogna reveals that the two verbs do not display similar morphosyntactic behavior; rather, volerci is characterized by the same structural properties as Old Italian bisogna. The strong morphosyntactic parallel between Old Italian bisogna and volerci leads to conclude that, although volerci has undergone grammaticalization to some degree, it has not lost the ability to project arguments, i.e., it has not become (yet) a modal functional element and is still a lexical verb.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.275.19rus,"New Perspectives on Romance Linguistics, Volume I: Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics",,978-90-272-4789-6,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006932238&site=ehost-live,2006,11/7/19 19:21,11/7/19 19:35,247-261,247,261,14,"xiii, 282",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 275,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,8,"<p>Accession Number: 2006932238.

The starting observation is that these paradigms seem to be always identical to an indicative agreement paradigm. The proposed generalization is the following: the morphological realization of agreement in subjunctive and imperative verbs is a consequence of the syntactic status of Tense in these two moods. This is illustrated with a morphological analysis of Romanian verbal agreement affixes. Syntactically, Tense is unspecified in subjunctives and absent in imperatives. This analysis makes specific prediction for the subjunctive and imperative morphology across languages. Subjunctive agreement paradigms a) will never show specific Tense-conditioned morphological operations and b) will not have a specific Tense affix. For imperatives, it is expected that a) morphological operations will never make appeal to a Tense feature in this mood; b) no Tense morpheme should appear in imperatives.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.275.18pir,"New Perspectives on Romance Linguistics, Volume I: Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics",,978-90-272-4789-6,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006932237&site=ehost-live,2006,11/7/19 19:21,11/7/19 19:34,229-245,229,245,16,"xiii, 282",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 275,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,3,"<p>Accession Number: 2006932237.

We adopt a theoretical approach to transitivity where interactions between modules of the grammar create a rich and flexible system of null objects in French (category N or pro); whereas a language like English contains only the former. The different complexity in the input predicts acquisitional differences between the two languages. Children heard stories with an individuated object referent (What did X do with y?) and stories that did not individuate an object referent (What did X do?). Results show that French children had substantially higher rates of omissions in both illicit and optional null object contexts than either French adults or English speaking children.

In this paper, I argue that variability is not equivalent to missing inflection, as defaults are typically incorrectly inflected for tense and person-number agreement. Data from the spontaneous production of 11 advanced and intermediate speakers of Spanish show that nonfinite defaults are rare, contrary to the expectations of the Missing Surface Inflection Hypothesis. Furthermore, default morphology is systematic: 3rd person acts as a default in non-3rd contexts, present-tense in past contexts, and singular in plural contexts—the reverse of these does not occur. I propose an underspecification-based theory, coupled with independently-derived markedness criteria, that predicts the morphemes that are adopted as defaults.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.275.16mcc,"New Perspectives on Romance Linguistics, Volume I: Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics",,978-90-272-4789-6,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006932235&site=ehost-live,2006,11/7/19 19:21,11/7/19 19:34,201-211,201,211,10,"xiii, 282",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 275,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,14,"<p>Accession Number: 2006932235.

These two clitics pattern together when contrasted with reflexive non-argumental clitic pronouns of Spanish with respect to the following properties: 1. the ability to elicit a telic interpretation of the predicate; 2. the ability to express an on/with entailment; 3. the ability to express temporary relations; 4. the ability to prevent idiomatic interpretation; and 5. the ability to be modified by adjectival secondary predicates. Considering these properties, it is shown that Spanish reflexives pattern with goal PPs (e.g. to) and that Spanish non-reflexives and Romanian reflexives pattern with directional PPs (e.g. toward). Based on these patterns, it is argued that each of these clitics is introduced as the complement of a null preposition that merges as a complement of the verb; the low merger of the null PP accounts for properties 4. and 5.

More precisely, the study focuses on the temporal clauses introduced by avant que or avant de in French (the equivalent of before in English). It explores arguments for the hypothesis that in some cases, avant que or (much more often) avant de may break away from the domain of presupposition, and play the role of temporal succession connectors between two asserted clauses. Such a construction (designated as the ‘assertive construction’) is related to the ‘quand inverse’ (“inverse when”) construction, both requiring a postposed temporal clause. The remarkable property associated with quand inverse – creation of a surprise effect – is lacking in the case of the assertive construction with avant que/de: however, it is put in evidence that the later can also give rise to specific semantic effects.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.275.13dra,"New Perspectives on Romance Linguistics, Volume I: Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics",,978-90-272-4789-6,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006932232&site=ehost-live,2006,11/7/19 19:21,11/7/19 19:33,155-167,155,167,12,"xiii, 282",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 275,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,7,"<p>Accession Number: 2006932232.

In the domain of causal conjunctions, there is a striking cross-linguistic trend for subordinating ‘because’ to supersede the corresponding coordinating conjunction. This study presents a corpus-based analysis of the use of French parce que in spoken discourse. It looks at the full array of uses of parce que and analyzes them within the information-structure framework of Lambrecht 1994. It shows that parce que clauses are always focal, whereas the main clause can be either focal or topical. If it is topical, the two clauses can be prosodically integrated into a single unit. If it is focal, the two clauses must be separated by some kind of break, allowing the hearer to reinterpret the matrix proposition as a presupposed topic before the causal proposition is processed.

Based on this observation, a number of works have suggested that these oblique arguments are a kind of quirky subject, similar (though not identical) to the quirky subjects of Icelandic. In this paper I provide evidence against these analyses. I show that Spanish preverbal obliques have none of the defining characteristics of quirky (or non-nominative) subjects. I also show that phenomena where Spanish and Icelandic seem to be similar are in fact unrelated and depend on entirely different grammatical conditions. I conclude by showing that the word order facts observed with these oblique arguments are unrelated to subjecthood. Rather, I show that unmarked word order in Spanish is regulated by the thematic roles of the arguments of the verb and not by subject properties. Hence, there are cases where an oblique argument occupies the preverbal position because its theta-role ranks higher in the Thematic Hierarchy than that of the grammatical subject.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.275.11gut,"New Perspectives on Romance Linguistics, Volume I: Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics",,978-90-272-4789-6,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006932230&site=ehost-live,2006,11/7/19 19:21,11/7/19 19:32,127-142,127,142,15,"xiii, 282",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 275,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,33,"<p>Accession Number: 2006932230.

The current study is a diachronic contribution to this literature, focusing on the development of one universal quantifier—chacun “each”—from 1100 through 1925. Old and Middle French chacun fulfilled a variety of syntactic functions: It was used as a pronoun, a modifier, and was found in emphatic constructions with the indefinite article (un chacun “a each”). By the 16th century, this surface heterogeneity gave way and pronominal chacun dominated. On the basis of the diachronic evidence, I first consider the possibility of extending an existing analysis of a different quantifier, aucun “none, not any,” to chacun. After arguing against this extension, I suggest that, contrary to appearances, a unified syntactic structure underlies the Old and Middle French chacun, and that this single construction gave rise to two modern syntactic structures.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.275.08edm,"New Perspectives on Romance Linguistics, Volume I: Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics",,978-90-272-4789-6,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006932227&site=ehost-live,2006,11/7/19 19:21,11/7/19 19:32,83-95,83,95,12,"xiii, 282",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 275,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,1,"<p>Accession Number: 2006932227.

This paper shows that number position incorrectly predicts these nominal properties in some languages, i.e. the French-based Creoles, and argues that better results obtain if the conceptual role of number is taken into account. Number interacts with two distinct processes in language: Quantization and Individuation. Number position matters only for languages with Number Individuation. Accordingly, not all languages that mark number primarily on D have equivalent properties and some are correctly predicted to freely allow BAN. The current paper has three parts. First Bouchard’s proposal, its empirical shortcomings, and the syntax of Haitian Creole (HC) number are discussed. Second, the conceptual role of number is outlined.

I argue that subjects do not appear in a single, unique position, but rather in several functional projections along the extended verbal projection. Consequently, different A and A-bar properties are expected. In some cases, the properties of those projections will be determined in the course of the derivation: if a verb raises to a certain projection, it will render this projection active for agreement purposes and trigger movement of the subject to its specifier.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.275.06cam,"New Perspectives on Romance Linguistics, Volume I: Morphology, Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics",,978-90-272-4789-6,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006932225&site=ehost-live,2006,11/7/19 19:21,11/7/19 19:31,51-66,51,66,15,"xiii, 282",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 275,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,35,"<p>Accession Number: 2006932225.

Hauser, Chomsky & Fitch (2002) hypothesize that the crucial property is a recursive system which links the Sensory-Motor system and the Conceptual-Intentional system. I assume that the distinctive property is that human language has signs: whereas an animal call is an immediate reflex response to a perceptual stimulation, a sign has a nonimmediate and potentially unlimited signifié. This expressive power comes from the arbitrariness of the sign, which has its source in the nature of the two substances involved: as Saussure compellingly argued, there is nothing in the nature of the perceptual substance or the conceptual substance to have any particular pairing. Recursion is a by-product of some of these substantive properties. This model has the advantage that it derives several other novel traits of language which appear to be unconnected in the HCF model.

We present a number of arguments in favor of the former option. We also show that the vP hypothesis allows for a fine-grained analysis that does justice to the complete semantics of the compounds. Within this analysis the element responsible for the nominalization fulfils a role very similar to the complementizer of relatives in the Vergnaud/Kayne approach to the latter.

In some Romance languages, the original opposition of case is lost, but the morphological opposition is refunctionalized to encode a distinction between a conjunctive and a disjunctive form. However, this phenomenon seems crucially not to involve ‘junk’, since it is always the original accusative which yields the conjunctive pronoun and the original dative which yields the disjunctive form. Instead, we are arguably dealing with ‘skeuomorphy’ – the state in which an opposition has been evacuated of its exponence, but retains some abstract identity which is not yet ‘junk’. If the opposition is refunctionalized, its refunctionalization will be guided by this residual dichotomy.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.276.14smi,"New Perspectives on Romance Linguistics, Volume II: Phonetics, Phonology and Dialectology",,978-90-272-4790-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006932252&site=ehost-live,2006,11/7/19 19:42,11/7/19 19:46,183-205,183,205,22,"ix, 205",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 276,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,11,"<p>Accession Number: 2006932252.

Furthermore, we show that the order in which the clitics appear affects whether stress is shifted to the penultimate or final clitic in a cluster. We propose that these pronouns that trigger stress shift are morphologically distinct from clitics: they are weak pronouns in the sense of Cardinaletti & Starke 1999. As weak pronouns they can be stressed, they are morphologically more complex than clitics. Syntactically, they are lower than clitics and they land in a Spec position.

That plural formation involves an output-to-output correspondence relation can be justified because Spanish plural suffixes attach to the morphological word, after all derivational and inflectional morphemes, including terminal elements. The proposed analysis overcomes the difficulties faced by previous accounts and provides a direct explanation of the pluralization facts, based on the distinction between input and output faithfulness proposed by optimality-theoretic Correspondence Theory (Benua 1995, McCarthy 1995). More specifically, epenthesis of [e] in the plural reflects the emergence of the unmarked (McCarthy and Prince 1994) with respect to the constraint against coda consonants (*CODA). *CODA is usually violated in the singular because of the domination of DEP-IO (input-to-output faithfulness) over *CODA (markedness); in the plural, however, since the relevant faithfulness constraint (DEP-OO) is dominated by markedness (*CODA), *CODA effects become visible, demanding open syllables",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.276.05col,"New Perspectives on Romance Linguistics, Volume II: Phonetics, Phonology and Dialectology",,978-90-272-4790-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006932244&site=ehost-live,2006,11/7/19 19:42,11/7/19 19:48,49-63,49,63,14,"ix, 205",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 276,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,11,"<p>Accession Number: 2006932244.

A moraic geminate structure is assumed for these segments to account for rather exceptional distributional and prosodic effects, particularly the narrowing of the stress window apparently triggered by palatal onsets in ultimae. I conduct a series of acoustic analyses on field data to identify acoustic features that might underpin this proposed geminate structure. I focus on prepalatal vowels and, in line with recent research, examine their duration, F2 profiles, and perceptual loudness. Results show that vowels before palatals are significantly longer than those before other types of consonants (occlusives and sonorants). This is explained in coarticulatory terms: anticipatory tongue-raising in the vowels – manifest in pronounced F2 excursions – is posited to exert a lengthening effect on the vowels as speakers negotiate target values with those of the rising F2, providing a perceptual basis for the posited moraic structure of the palatals in question.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.276.02bak,"New Perspectives on Romance Linguistics, Volume II: Phonetics, Phonology and Dialectology",,978-90-272-4790-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006932241&site=ehost-live,2006,11/7/19 19:42,11/7/19 19:50,1-14,1,14,13,"ix, 205",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 276,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,4,"<p>Accession Number: 2006932241.

Double prosody leads to questioning the very nature of syncope, is not obvious in the cases of desyllabification where it leads to a far more elaborate account, is not helpful in dealing with the stress shift from prefix to stem, and, does not prevent syncope from rendering the stress system opaque. Sharing Bullocks (2001) intuition of a relation between syncope and stress shift, an OT account is proposed which expresses that relation in a more direct and less abstract way and obviates the need for double prosody in accounting for the stress shifts.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.276.11jac,"New Perspectives on Romance Linguistics, Volume II: Phonetics, Phonology and Dialectology",,978-90-272-4790-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2006901644&site=ehost-live,2006,11/7/19 19:42,11/7/19 19:47,141-154,141,154,13,"ix, 205",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 276,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,2,"<p>Accession Number: 2006901644.

To conclude, we have argued in favor of a syntactic-based compositional analysis of manner and motion within the verbal phase. This can be overtly observed in SVC languages. Germanic languages (which are not SVC languages) make use of the Compound Rule to compose manner and motion. The Romance languages cannot do so because in Romance compounding is lexically-determined and semantically frozen.

Progress has been made by initiating a line of experimental research regarding the properties of PAL in Romanian. The primary objective of this study was to answer a basic question, that is, whether native speakers are sensitive to word-final PAL, and to what extent they make use of it in distinguishing between word meanings. Based on the results of the experiments described in this study, the following generalization can be formulated: native speakers actively use PAL in decoding word meanings, although the degree to which this is achieved varies considerably depending on the palatalized consonants’ primary POA, and on whether other cues to morphological status are present in the sentence. For all POAs, the results raise challenging questions related to the existing typology and descriptions of PAL in other languages. First, labials were found not to differ significantly from dentals, an unexpected result in light of Kochetov's markedness asymmetry with respect to place, according to which labials are more marked than coronals. The results for the dental POA were noteworthy in that a significant interaction between place and PAL was identified with this place, a pattern which should be addressed in future research. Finally, it is of interest that, while Romanian appears to exhibit the atypical existence of a plain-palatalized contrast at the post-alveolar POA, the subjects were insensitive to this contrast.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.287.22spi,Romance Linguistics 2006,,978-90-272-4802-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2008932467&site=ehost-live,2007,11/7/19 22:20,11/7/19 22:28,303-317,303,317,14,"viii, 340",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 287,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,12,"<p>Accession Number: 2008932467.

This variety, as it occurs with many metropolitan varieties, is the result of leveling processes motivated by intensive dialect contact in the city, due to growth and migration from different dialectal areas. If our long-term goal were to be able to reconstruct previous stages of Catalan (and Romance) intonation, it is clear that we would need data from other dialects as well. In the present paper, we take a rather descriptive approach and analyze in detail the shape of melodic contours in declaratives (in read speech) in Majorcan Catalan. Alignment patterns are also analyzed in detail. The present descriptive study of the shape and alignment of nonfinal pitch gestures in declaratives in MC has arrived at the following two conclusions: (i) the position in the utterance of host words seems to determine the shape of pitch gestures in that penultimate contours have always a rising shape while antepenultimate ones tend to have a falling shape (consistently for two speakers and less consistently for one, while the fourth speaker shows no evidence for falling pitch accents), and (ii) pitch turning points such as peaks in rises and valleys in falls are timed with respect to the duration of word parts, which is the time stretch between the onset of the tonic and the word edge.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.287.21sim,Romance Linguistics 2006,,978-90-272-4802-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2008932466&site=ehost-live,2007,11/7/19 22:20,11/7/19 22:20,289-302,289,302,13,"viii, 340",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 287,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,,"<p>Accession Number: 2008932466.

By contrast languages that are similar to European Spanish in the sense that they use a HAVE -copula in the existential construction, do not display it. I will attribute this difference to the presence of an accusative case head in HAVE -copula constructions. This head displays an Agree-relation with the associate, which bleeds Agree between T and the associate. In BE -copula languages on the other hand, this head is absent. Hence, Agree between T and the copula is not blocked.

The claim that the PCC holds crosslinguistically has also been previously challenged by Haspelmath (2004), who argues that the PCC (the “Ditransitive Person Role Constraint”, as the author calls it) is not universal, but rather, it is only a preference. However, Haspelmath lists Romanian as a language that is actually subject to this constraint, contrary to fact. Second, the data presented will bring forth another interesting aspect of the Romanian clitic system, which, to my knowledge, has not been reported so far for other clitic languages: namely, no person restrictions on the possible combinations of clitics arise in post-verbal position, when clitics occur after true imperatives and gerunds (section 2.2). Third, I will provide a syntactic analysis of the combinatorial possibilities of Romanian object clitics (section 3). In conclusion, we could suggest that not only is it the case that the PCC is not a universal constraint governing the distribution of clitics, but, more strongly, that the PCC is not a primitive of UG 14 . Restrictions on clitic combinations and ordering in languages that have otherwise been considered to be subject to the PCC would be derived through an elaboration of the current approach, which would allow for parametric variation.

APNFJVH7,journalArticle,2007,"Rodriguez, Joshua","Rodriguez, Joshua",,,,,,Macro Events and 'Aspect Shift' in Spanish,Macro Events And 'aspect Shift' In Spanish,"...I have argued that cognitive stative verbs can be characterized as systematically polysemous. The range of meaning is limited by three factors: (a) what I have called a macro event, or lexically provided initiating β -event correlated with a minimally overlapping resulting α -state, (b) the inchoative relation INCHO, which allows more than one type of inchoative interpretation, and (c), the operator B L (i.e., Left Boundary ), which maps an event predicate (or set of events) to a distinct set of events which represent the respective initial and instantaneous subevents of the former. In so doing, I have agreed with the traditional classification of verbs like comprender, conocer and saber as being in some sense inherently stative, but have also added the inherent potential to denote a secondary meaning that meets the requirements imposed by the inchoative relation INCHO. In this way, the cognitive stative verbs may be distinguished from other non-cognitive stative verbs, such as tener que ( have to ) or consistir ( to consist ), which lack any inchoative potential. That is, the former type includes INCHO in its lexical specification, while the latter does not.

I carry out an analysis of variation to demonstrate that there exists a relationship between subject position and verb type, and that this test can be used to differentiate between the three verb types. I then use the subject position test to find out if the controversial class of verbs of light and sound emission (VLSEs) should be classified as unaccusative, following Perlmutter (1978), or as unergative, following Mendikoetxea (1999). The results will show that these verbs behave as unaccusative in Spanish. Finally, I explore some consequences derived from the adoption of this specific classification, which provides some theoretical advantages regarding the inclusion of VLSEs in the unaccusative group. In particular, I show how the class of verbs that display locative alternation in Spanish can receive a uniform account when emission verbs are described as unaccusative rather than unergative. The organization of this paper is as follows. In section 2, I briefly discuss the properties and specific features of Spanish subject arguments. In section 3, I provide an introduction to the classification of verb types in Spanish and some of the difficulties that this classification entails. Experiment 1, in section 4, I carry out a quantitative analysis of subject position in Spanish and show that it can help identify verb types.

Our working hypothesis is that (i) construal relations, even those with resumptive pronouns, derive from movement (Kayne, 2001; Hornstein, 2001, among others) and (ii) that subjacency effects are a function of the type of movement, integral or partial, and, if partial, of the agreement relation between the moved constituent and the element left in-situ. Functionally, we propose that languages can resort to different types of movement depending on whether the topic is contrastive or not. The movement analysis of topic constructions allowed us to consider VPT and VPRT as similar in nature to CLLD. Both are instances of partial movement, the former two with a verbal resumptive and the latter with a clitic resumptive. In partial movement, when the anti-agreement condition between the topic and the resumptive element is satisfied, both allow construal to obtain in island contexts. It was also shown that argument extraction can occur in both varieties, but BP resorts to partial argument extraction (leaving a null clitic in the base position), while EP resorts to integral movement (leaving a trace). It was also our claim that argument extraction is selected for noncontrastive topicalization, while VPT, in its full or remnant form, underlies contrastive topics. Thus, contrastive and non-contrastive Topicalization, even though they resemble each other at spell-out, constitute different structures in both varieties.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.287.15kat,Romance Linguistics 2006,,978-90-272-4802-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2008932457&site=ehost-live,2007,11/7/19 22:20,11/7/19 22:25,205-218,205,218,13,"viii, 340",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 287,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,22,"<p>Accession Number: 2008932457.

We consider both spontaneous, longitudinal production data from two very young girls growing up bilingually from birth, and experimental, cross-sectional production data by 28 slightly older bilingual children whose age of first exposure to Dutch is between birth and age 4. This paper presents an exploratory study which hopes to show that the acquisition of gender morphology in early child bilingualism is a challenging domain of research which raises new and important questions concerning possible explanations of deviant development in early child bilingualism. In the first part of the paper we present some background information on the grammatical gender of the Dutch and French definite determiner and its acquisition, as reported in the recent literature. On the basis of these findings, we try to make some predictions for the acquisition of this phenomenon in the production data of the bilingual children under consideration.

I will claim that an explanation requires attention not just to the syntactic properties of the languages in question, but also to the way in which syntactic structures are processed. I will restrict my discussion here to Spanish and English, but the basic approach may be extendable to other Romance languages as well. The puzzling difference between Romance and English with regard to the acquisition of inversion in wh -questions now seems much more understandable. In the course of acquisition in English, we are in effect seeing children struggle with a language-particular process that is not mandated by UG, with the individual variation and extended period of acquisition that we would expect. In Spanish, we are seeing children do the best they can with the syntactic knowledge that they have acquired, but producing wh -questions with an overt preverbal subject goes beyond their (and adults’) processing abilities. I have not attempted here to extend this analysis to Romance languages such as European Portuguese, Catalan, and Italian, which behave similarly in many respects, but such an extension appears promising. It should be obvious that the analysis I have developed here has only been possible by taking seriously the roles of both the grammar and the processor in determining sentence acceptability, so to the extent that this analysis has been successful, it constitutes an argument in favor of pursuing such an approach.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.287.13goo,Romance Linguistics 2006,,978-90-272-4802-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2008932455&site=ehost-live,2007,11/7/19 22:20,11/7/19 22:24,169-182,169,182,13,"viii, 340",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 287,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,14,"<p>Accession Number: 2008932455.

We will assume here, following Chomsky (2005), that the syntactic opaqueness of subjects follows from the special status of particularly designated positions: the phase edges ; we therefore depart not only from Uniformity and Spell-out based approaches to islands (see Takahashi 1994 and Uriagereka 1999a, respectively), but also from those capitalizing on Chomsky’s (2000; 2001) Activity Condition (see Boeckx 2003). A more specific aim of the paper concerns the non-uniform status of the Subject Condition , which, as noted by Stepanov (2001), can be circumvented in various languages. We propose that this is due to an independently existing process that, under certain conditions, modifies phase boundaries. We call it Phase Sliding . The paper is divided as follows: section 2 briefly reviews previous minimalist accounts of the Subject Condition, all of which coincide in SPEC-T being a ‘freezing’ position; in section 3 we reproduce Chomsky’s (2005) analysis of edges as Probe-proof domains for sub-extraction; section 4 focuses on a language that circumvents the Subject Condition, Spanish, a fact we try to relate to an old intuition about the nature of T/INFL in Romance (see Kayne 1989, Rizzi 1982, and Uribe-Etxebarria 1992, among others), which we recast in phase-based terms; section 5 summarizes the main conclusions.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.287.12gal,Romance Linguistics 2006,,978-90-272-4802-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2008932454&site=ehost-live,2007,11/7/19 22:20,11/7/19 22:24,155-168,155,168,13,"viii, 340",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 287,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,88,"<p>Accession Number: 2008932454.

On the basis of negative concord structures in Romanian, I argue that n-words are semantically negative, despite their systematic co-occurrence with an item that is usually viewed as sentential negation. The possible readings of sentences with more than one n-word provide an important argument for this hypothesis and thus challenge any view of negative concord as a polarity phenomenon. I will defend an analysis of n-words as negative quantifiers, as implemented in the polyadic approach of de Swart & Sag (2002). This study focuses on the semantic properties of n-words in Romanian and rejects the claim that double negation readings are never possible in strict negative concord languages. I have established a new empirical generalization regarding the distribution of the double negation reading in Romanian, which is available with two or more n-words, but ruled out when sentential negation licenses a single n-word. Since double negation is a marked reading, subject to pragmatic constraints, be it in double negation or negative concord languages, its low frequency is not surprising. I argue that the distribution of double negation readings in Romanian suggests that an analysis of n-words as nonnegative elements is untenable. This conclusion is further supported by the absence of existential, non-negative reading of n-words in Romanian. Furthermore, various empirical tests clearly distinguish n-words from negative polarity items. I conclude that any analysis of strict negative concord as a polarity phenomenon is ruled out for Romanian.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.287.11fal,Romance Linguistics 2006,,978-90-272-4802-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2008932453&site=ehost-live,2007,11/7/19 22:20,11/7/19 22:24,141-154,141,154,13,"viii, 340",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 287,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,5,"<p>Accession Number: 2008932453.

More precisely, this paper analyzes the use of performative verbs in historical court documents of the Viceroyalty of Peru written in Spanish in the late 16th century and early 17th century. With respect to performative verbs -the focus of this paper- the data suggest that the Spanish or the bilingual origin of the document favors the use of different types of performative verbs. I find that while in both the monolingual and bilingual documents verbs of both types of ASSERTIVES are found, in the bilingual documents, strong assertives (represented in the use of the verb jurar 'to swear') are favored to reinforce the truth of the description and assertion of the facts describing the wrong done to the bilingual claimant. The monolingual documents make use of an additional set of verbs which can also have performative meaning (i.e. mental and perception verbs) asserting the truth of the proposition. Haverkate has described assertive verbs as neither speaker nor addressee centered (1984). However, in the use of mental and perception verbs, the monolingual documents are focusing the truth of the proposition on the speaker; while in the bilingual documents, in favoring strong assertives, they are centering the truth of the proposition on the addressee. The bilingual claimants seem to make use of this strategy to assure the addressee, in this case the Spanish court, of the truthfulness of their deposition.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.287.10esc,Romance Linguistics 2006,,978-90-272-4802-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2008932452&site=ehost-live,2007,11/7/19 22:20,11/7/19 22:24,127-140,127,140,13,"viii, 340",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 287,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,5,"<p>Accession Number: 2008932452.

The paper is organized as follows. Evidence that stress is not a necessary factor in the behavior of schwa is presented in section 2. Section 3 develops an analysis involving constraints on the size of prosodic constituents and perceptually based constraints requiring consonants to be adjacent to a vowel, which distinguish between consonants in the middle and at the margins of prosodic phrases. This analysis is expanded in section 4 by the addition of segmental constraints which account for a contrast between stops and fricatives in their tendency to trigger schwa insertion. This expansion further illustrates how segmental and rhythmic constraints interact and predict the relative likelihood of schwa in different contexts. Section 5 discusses the status of a potential contrast between two and more than two syllables (in addition to that between one and more than one). The discussion will focus on frequency effects at word boundaries (2). I believe the same analysis is valid for compounds (1), with two differences. Compounds involve prosodic constituents at a lower level and they induce categorical rather than relative frequency effects on schwa distribution. There are advantages in looking at word boundaries. They exhibit a wider range of rhythmic and segmental possibilities and the variable nature of schwa insertion in this context reveals interactions between the rhythmic and segmental environments that are not visible word-internally due to the categorical behavior of schwa. The interpretation of the data at word boundaries is also not complicated by issues of lexical productivity that arise in internal contexts.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.287.07cot,Romance Linguistics 2006,,978-90-272-4802-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2008932449&site=ehost-live,2007,11/7/19 22:20,11/7/19 22:23,81-95,81,95,14,"viii, 340",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 287,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,12,"<p>Accession Number: 2008932449.

9K27DXRF,journalArticle,2007,"Cardinaletti, Anna","Cardinaletti, Anna",,,,,,Subjects and Wh-Questions: Some New Generalizations,Subjects And Wh-questions: Some New Generalizations,"This paper addresses the long-standing question of the restricted distribution of subjects in wh -questions in languages like Italian: *Chi Gianni ha invitato?, *Chi ha Gianni invitato?, Chi ha invitato, Gianni? “whom Gianni has invited?”. It is commonly assumed that this restriction is a direct consequence of the special syntax attributed to the subject in Null Subject languages (NSLs). I will show that this is incorrect. The following generalizations regarding the occurrence of subjects in wh-questions seem to hold.
 
- the restriction against subjects occurring between a wh-phrase and the verb is very specific and only concerns the highest subjects in the syntactic tree (DPs and strong pronouns); 
- the restricted distribution of these subjects in wh-questions does not correlate with pro-drop, since it is also found in non-NSLs; 
- the restriction, instead, seems to correlate with verb movement: although in Italian the verb raises higher in interrogatives than in declaratives, it does not reach the C layer; in other words, no T-to-C occurs; 
- the postverbal subject occurring in wh-questions is marginalized, i. e. destressed in situ. 

In this paper, I will concentrate on questions in main clauses, and I will address similar restrictions in embedded clauses in future work. In conclusion, the syntax of subjects in wh -questions does not depend on pro-drop. IP-internal strong subjects are possible if T and C are related (by Movement or Agree). Left-peripheral (strong) subjects are left-dislocated, right-peripheral (strong) subjects are marginalized (or right-dislocated if an object precedes them).",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.287.06car,Romance Linguistics 2006,,978-90-272-4802-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2008932448&site=ehost-live,2007,11/7/19 22:20,11/7/19 22:23,57-79,57,79,22,"viii, 340",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 287,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,45,"<p>Accession Number: 2008932448.

Evidence from the Future Tense in L2 Spanish,Interpretive Deficit? Evidence From The Future Tense In L2 Spanish,"Recent research into second language acquisition has focused on how different modules of the grammar interact during acquisition. Results of these investigations into interfaces have led some researchers to argue that they may be particularly vulnerable in several types of processes, including simultaneous bilingualism, L2 acquisition and impaired acquisition (Sorace and Keller 2005, among others). Vulnerability is translated as delayed acquisition, difficulty, and perhaps failure to acquire. In this paper we will examine the interface between morphology and semantics in second language acquisition. We will focus on knowledge of the different interpretations of future tense morphology in Spanish. On the one hand, the future tense can refer to future time, as expected. On the other, it can imply probability, that is, how probable the speaker considers the action in the real world, in the present time. This is a classic case of ambiguity, in which, in order to interpret a sentence, an understanding of the context is crucial. We will show that an understanding of this type of ambiguity is acquirable in adult second language acquisition.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.287.05bru,Romance Linguistics 2006,,978-90-272-4802-2,,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2008932447&site=ehost-live,2007,11/7/19 22:20,11/7/19 22:22,43-56,43,56,13,"viii, 340",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 287,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,8,"<p>Accession Number: 2008932447.

In this paper, we argued that at least some parenthetical clauses are structurally dependent . In particular, we explored the dependence between the resuming clitic in PNT and the subject DP in the main clause, and the dependency with an evidential adverb that we argued to be structural in nature. We argued that PNT has the structure of CLLD with a null topic, and is an adverbial. This analysis differs from Stowell (2005), who argues that English sentences similar to PNT are restrictive relative clauses. As we showed a relative clause analysis is not feasible for the Romance data. Moreover, we observe that unlike CLLD, PNT manifest additional locality and contextual restrictions; no DP can intervene between the null topic and the DP subject in the main clause, although the intervention of a verb is parametrically permitted in Romance. We further proposed that the null topic must be c-commanded by or be in the specifier of an EvidentialP projection. The various conditions on PNT explored in this paper provide strong arguments that at least certain types of parenthetical constructions are structurally dependent on their surrounding sentence.

However, not all cases are amenable to this account, as no single phonetic property unifies the class of rhotics. We examine two cases involving intrasyllabic rhotic metathesis: rightward movement of /R/ in French and leftward movement of /r/ in Spanish. In Optimality Theory (Prince & Smolensky 1993), we formalize diachronic metathesis in terms of separate production and perception grammars, which account for the source of variance and the selection of innovative underlying forms, respectively. In production, gestural alignment constraints favor complete overlap of adjacent rhotic and vowel gestures, whose linear ordering is thereby rendered indeterminate. The output of the production grammar serves as input to the perception grammar, which maps surface forms to underlying forms in accordance with attested patterns of the language.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.304.21web,Romance Linguistics 2007,,978-90-272-4820-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2009932249&site=ehost-live,2009,11/8/19 21:29,11/8/19 21:29,321-337,321,337,16,"vii, 361",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 304,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,,"<p>Accession Number: 2009932249.

While this palatalization or “desyllabification” has been assumed to apply at the right edge of a word, we demonstrate that the word boundary does not provide the appropriate context. Instead, we propose that the phenomenon applies within a phonological constituent located in the prosodic hierarchy between the Phonological Word and the Phonological Phrase – the Composite Group, a revised form of the Clitic Group. Our analysis accounts for both enclitics and proclitics, which must be excluded from the PW of the associated root since the PW is the domain for stress assignment.

Both perceptual studies of palatalization and cross-linguistic distributional patterns suggest the existence of a markedness asymmetry: palatalized labials are more marked than palatalized coronals. This paper presents the results of a perceptual study of labial and coronal fricatives, with 22 native speakers of Romanian. It was found that, unlike Russian and Japanese listeners, Romanians exhibit higher sensitivity to the plain-palatalized contrast in labials as opposed to coronals. Thus Romanian seems to pose a challenge to the typological generalization. Several differences between Romanian and other languages with the plain/palatalized contrast are discussed. It is suggested that the different behavior of Romanian may be due to the different nature of palatalization in this language with regard to its phonetic realization and its position in the syllable (final only).",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.304.18spi,Romance Linguistics 2007,,978-90-272-4820-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2009932246&site=ehost-live,2009,11/8/19 21:29,11/8/19 21:29,277-289,277,289,12,"vii, 361",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 304,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,4,"<p>Accession Number: 2009932246.

In a word naming task, the patterning of production errors and reaction times proves statistically different across the three word types. The three-way split among proscriptions, historical gaps, and licit gaps challenges traditional approaches to quantity sensitivity which consider syllables binarily “light” or “heavy.” The results suggest a gradient sensitivity to varying degrees of syllable weight.

Participants took part in a perceptual task in which they were asked to discriminate between the peak alignments. The results indicate that participants had a bias to respond “same” to the majority of the experimental trials, which may explain why performance on “different” trials was poor. Sensitivity (A’) scores, however, indicate that overall, participants could discriminate some differences in the signal.

Drawing on Hale & Keyser’s (2000) analysis of so-called ‘P-cognation’, we argue that the formation of Italian phrasal verbs (e.g., mettere giù ‘put down’ orbuttare via ‘throw away’) involves a lexical-syntactic pattern where the directional particle specifies the Path element that has already been conflated in the verb: that is, the verb itself encodes or involves a directional meaning which is further specified through a P(ath) particle. We argue that Romance languages like Italian or Catalan have verb particle constructions involving ‘P-cognation’ but lack those ones involving a lexical-syntactic subordination process whereby an independent root is merged with a null verb (e.g., John worked the night away). As predicted by Talmy’s typology, the latter are found in ‘satelliteframed languages’ like English but not in ‘verb-framed languages’ like Italian or Catalan.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.304.15mat,Romance Linguistics 2007,,978-90-272-4820-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2009932243&site=ehost-live,2009,11/8/19 21:29,11/8/19 21:29,227-241,227,241,14,"vii, 361",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 304,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,14,"<p>Accession Number: 2009932243.

The first is derived by NP-raising, and the relative clause is selected by a determiner (Kayne 1994). The second is a matching structure and involves operator movement as in the traditional analysis of relative clauses. This latter structure also respects antisymmetry, since a non-overt determiner selects the relative clause in the complement position of a Determiner Phrase, and the head of the relative clause in the Specifier. The operator in this structure may be a Determiner Phrase or a Noun Phrase. While prepositionless relative clauses with que ‘that’ employ a non overt operator, relative clauses with prepositional operators show an allomorphic variation in the case of DP-operators, since the determiner is overt. Relative clauses with coordinated heads, relative clauses with the same preposition selecting the head and the operator, and (anti)reconstruction effects further support this analysis.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.304.14mar,Romance Linguistics 2007,,978-90-272-4820-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2009932242&site=ehost-live,2009,11/8/19 21:29,11/8/19 21:29,209-225,209,225,16,"vii, 361",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 304,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,,"<p>Accession Number: 2009932242.

Velar palatalisation applies in the plural forms of some nouns and in some it does not. When confronted with novel words and the task to produce plural forms speakers split into two groups, those that apply palatalisation to all new forms and those that do not apply the process. The conclusion drawn from these results is that a uniform but ambiguous surface pattern is analysed in different ways by individual speakers, hence, showing crypto-variation. The results give evidence supporting Pater’s (2006) proposal that exceptional application of a process is due to lexical indexation of markedness constraints and exceptional underapplication is due to lexical indexation of faithfulness constraints in Optimality Theory.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.304.13kra,Romance Linguistics 2007,,978-90-272-4820-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2009932241&site=ehost-live,2009,11/8/19 21:29,11/8/19 21:29,193-208,193,208,15,"vii, 361",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 304,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,9,"<p>Accession Number: 2009932241.

These behaviors are analyzed within an alignment approach to second-position effects, with clitics treated as instantiating agreement features and positioned post-syntactically (following Legendre 1998).

Phonological innovations in a particular group of Judeo-Spanish dialects point to a novel generalization regarding the labiovelar glide, namely that /w/ is realized as secondary labialization on a preceding consonant. Evidence supporting this structural innovation comes from an asymmetry in the distribution of labialization. In these dialects, prevocalic /w/ strengthens to a labialized dorsal obstruent in syllable-initial position (gwéso ‘bone’) but is realized as a secondary articulation on a preceding labial (pwéðe ‘can’) or dorsal (kwé.ðra ‘rope’). Labialized coronals are disallowed and show several historical reflexes depending on the coronal’s manner of articulation: nasal place assimilation (nwe>mwe), medial vowel epenthesis (twe>tuywe), and prothesis (swe>esmwe).

This paper proposes that subordinate phrases apparently headed by a null complementizer in Old French are in fact lexically selected CPs with an EPP feature in C. We argue that subordinate clauses in the subjunctive provide evidence against the traditional parataxis analysis, as the mood is clearly lexically selected for by the main verb. Our analysis accounts not only for the distribution of complementizer phrases not headed by a complementizer in OF, but also for their loss diachronically, as the EPP feature of subordinate C was lost in the evolution from OF to MF.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.304.03art,Romance Linguistics 2007,,978-90-272-4820-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2009932231&site=ehost-live,2009,11/8/19 21:29,11/8/19 21:29,19-36,19,36,17,"vii, 361",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 304,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,10,"<p>Accession Number: 2009932231.

I argue that agreement, understood as uninterpretable phi-features (i.e., uph), is not compulsory for either Case licensing or for obtaining a Case value. Nonetheless, I show that the presence of uph on the probing domain will ensure a Nominative value, while its absence will constrain the DP to an Accusative value. I propose that a null expletive checking the EPP feature will trigger Nominative subjects whenever (C)-T lacks uph, specifically, in non-finite domains, such as infinitives and gerunds. I offer evidence for expletive pro as a UG primitive from Romanian binding facts and provide an analysis of Case valuation in this language. Lastly, I discuss micro-parametric variation in subject lexicalization within null expletive languages.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.304.02alb,Romance Linguistics 2007,,978-90-272-4820-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2009932230&site=ehost-live,2009,11/8/19 21:29,11/8/19 21:29,1-18,1,18,17,"vii, 361",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 304,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,19,"<p>Accession Number: 2009932230.

The results of a delayed naming task testing native speakers’ reactions to nonwords containing licit vs. proscribed patterns of stress and syllable structure offer empirical data to inform models of speech production. While the findings generally support a postlexical locus of syllable-level encoding (Levelt et al. 1999), the data also pose challenges for this model. It is argued that the model must identify more clearly the locus of and the interaction between stress-level and syllable-level encoding.

The account follows Rodriguez (2007) in exploiting lexical ambiguities to provide a richer set of VP Aktionsarten via normal compositional semantics. Crucially it is the addition of aspectually specific morphology that functions to filter out those VP interpretations which have incompatible Aktionsarten. The purported shifting effect therefore derives from one or another VP meaning (potentially including alternating NP denotations as well) in association with corresponding morphology via aspectual compatibility. The analysis provides a natural means for explaining why certain cases of ‘aspect shift’ do not occur, namely on the basis of the lack of the underlying semantic potentials of the words involved.

This contrast correlates with an asymmetry in the combinatorial possibilities of plural vs singular clitics: namely, plural clitics in direct object position in Romanian affect the acceptability of clitic clusters, as confirmed in quantitative acceptability judgements with multiple informants. Rather than invoking a new ‘Number Case Constraint’ governing the distribution of clitics, we link the Romanian data to familiar facts from Leísta dialects of Spanish, which manifest case syncretism between dative and animate accusative 3rd person clitics. We implement the fact that 1st and 2nd person plural clitics in Romanian are case-syncretic by implicationally marking them as inherently [+animate] in the syntax. The severe degradation in acceptability of clusters with direct object plural clitics is accounted for by following aspects of Adger & Harbour’s (2007) proposal for the connection between syncretism and the Person Case Constraint.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.313.17nev,Romance Linguistics 2008: Interactions in Romance,,978-90-272-4831-2 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2010933618&site=ehost-live,2010,11/8/19 21:31,11/8/19 21:54,185-199,185,199,14,"vii, 266",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 313,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,23,"<p>Accession Number: 2010933618.

The central claim is that two elision processes have to be distinguished, one that applies to determiners and is closer to categorical variation, to be analyzed in part as allomorphy, and another process that applies to pronouns and is closer to free variation. Italian elision is modeled in a simple optimality-theoretic constraint hierarchy: it is shown that the patterns of variation can be learned by the Gradual Learning Algorithm (Boersma & Hayes 2001), but only if two different grammars are learned for elision on determiners and on pronouns, respectively.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.313.08gar,Romance Linguistics 2008: Interactions in Romance,,978-90-272-4831-2 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2010933610&site=ehost-live,2010,11/8/19 21:31,11/8/19 21:53,57-72,57,72,15,"vii, 266",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 313,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,3,"<p>Accession Number: 2010933610.

A Comparative Study Of Vocalic Sequences In Argentine Spanish,"We investigate the realization of iV sequences in a contact (CV) and noncontact (NCV) variety of Argentine Spanish. We test the following hypotheses: (1) diphthongization is increasing in CV; (2) diphthongization is sensitive to the etymological origin of the sequence; (3) delateralization in CV is an attractor for diphthongization. Results only support (1) and (2). While hiatuses are more frequent in CV, both varieties share the pan-Hispanic preference for diphthongs. However, CV and NCV differ from each other and from Peninsular varieties in the environments where hiatuses are left: NCV maintains few exceptional hiatuses and CV is less sensitive to the etymological origin of the sequence. Additionally, CV and NCV differ in the realization of diphthongs and of the diphthong/hiatus contrast: CV diphthongs are more coarticulated with V2 and more clearly differentiated from hiatuses.

Such patterns have been variously attributed to transfer/interference and loss of discourse-pragmatic constraints, among other factors. The situation discussed here is unique in that both languages are null subject languages in an environment of sustained bilingualism. Drawing on a variationist analysis of naturalistic data, the present work reveals a marked increase in overall rates of pronoun expression in Chipilo contact Spanish relative to monolingual Mexican Spanish; however, the patterning of overt pronoun use is similar to that of monolingual varieties of Mexican Spanish.

I propose that the semantic content of this new type of exclamative is a gradation construction with an implicit threshold clause and focus on the quantifier.

The two vowels realize different heads of the clausal skeleton (in the CP and the IP layer, respectively), can be found in one and the same dialect, and can co-occur in one and the same clause.

The form of the imperative with the accretion coincides with the inflectional stem that is found in other forms of the imperative paradigm.

A detailed analysis of the verbal paradigm of Korlai Creole Portuguese reveals that verbs encode conjugation classes but no subject agreement endings. The same inflectional development has taken place in two more Indo-Portuguese creoles, namely Daman and Diu Creole Portuguese, casting serious doubts on the traditional claim that creoles discard semantically dispensable units. In order to understand why creoles select purely formal inflectional categories, this paper draws on the distinction, formulated by Booij (1994, 1996), between inherent and contextual inflection. Based on this distinction, I argue that the retention of conjugation class markers vs. the loss of agreement endings can be subsumed under a wider generalisation about creole languages, namely their preference for inherent rather than contextual inflection (Kihm 2003; Arends et al. 2006; Plag 2008a).

At issue is the treatment of situations in which a particular initial non-subject element can participate in either V2 or V3 order. The current paper focuses on sentences in which the initial element is a fronted subordinate clause. Using a diachronic data base of 13th-century prose, we argue first for a revision in the criteria for identifying V3 that reduces the number of such examples considerably. We then show that the rate of V2 vs. V3 with fronted clauses varies with respect to date, genre, and fronted-clause type in ways that suggest a syntactic change in progress rather than the absence of V2 effects.

Naturalistic data collected via sociolinguistic interviews in Valladolid and Minorca, Spain, were explored using a variationist approach, with a total of 7,025 tokens.

Yet, verbs normally enter into an agreement relationship with the (overt/null) subject. In some cases, however, certain acceptable sentences contain an anomalously-agreeing subject in terms of one of the three agreement/ó-features, namely person, number, and gender. Assuming that the nominals in question establish an Agree relationship with the verb à la Chomsky (2000, 2001, 2004, 2008), I submit that in Spanish there is an operative condition on the output of Agree, which posits that if full/optimal agreement between the verb and the subject does not obtain, at most one feature can be left unchecked/ unvalued syntactically. The remaining unvalued feature of T0 is deleted/valued for convergence through alternative agreement mechanisms available in the grammar, including default agreement and possibly semantic/pragmatic agreement. From this, it follows that agreement in Spanish may not be a quintessentially syntactic phenomenon handled exclusively by a probe-goal system like Chomsky’s Agree.

I show that Romanian has a null object used as a bound variable with a neuter pronoun antecedent. This item differs from parasitic gaps by the fact that it does not require an A-bar moved antecedent and can only occur with neuter pronouns, while overt clitics are excluded in this context. I propose that this is due to the fact that object clitics are always marked for gender, while neuter pronouns are genderless.

Propre (“own”) has two possible interpretations: its semantic effect consists in contrasting either the possessor (possessor propre) or the possessum (possessum propre) with a set of contextually determined alternatives. Crucially, these double intensifying properties of propre correlate with the binding properties of son propre. When son is associated with possessor propre, son propre behaves like an anaphor that can be long distance bound if the antecedent is a logophoric center. However, when son is associated with possessum propre, son propre lacks both anaphoric and logophoric properties. This correlation shows that there is an interaction between the modules of binding and intensification: it is only when the referent of its antecedent (i.e. the possessor) is intensified that son propre needs to be bound.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.315.11cha,Romance Linguistics 2009,,978-90-272-4833-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2011930597&site=ehost-live,2010,11/8/19 21:39,11/8/19 21:46,187-202,187,202,15,"xiv, 426",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 315,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,4,"<p>Accession Number: 2011930597.

The FS has been reported in only a few dialects of Spanish (Venezuelan, Colombian, Ecuadorian, Dominican, and Panamanian), and it is not stigmatized, despite being dialectally marked. Although the FS shows some resemblance to the pseudo-cleft construction, the syntactic analysis included here is based on the premise that the two forms are syntactically different. Looking at the syntactic contexts in which this form may occur, I show that the FS may precede any kind of phrase, serving any kind of syntactic function, as long as it is post-verbal. Furthermore, I illustrate that the agreement relation between FS ser and certain sentential constituents is not random. At the end, I present compelling evidence to suggest that the FS is in a TP-internal Focus Phrase, generated below TP and above vP.

It is suggested that two otherwise regular sound changes, -m deletion and identical vowel simplification (/ee/ >/e/), failed to occur in a small number of lexical items in order to avoid their impeding reduction to a subminimal size, and that yod accretion in the Old Spanish monosyllabic forms do, so, vo, and estó was also driven by compliance with a minimal word requirement.

According to previous studies, the final H tone of a phrase is usually either maintained as a level tone with no L% boundary tone, or is downstepped to a mid tone. The present study examines phrase-final combinations of words ending in tonic vowels followed by one or more negative, possessive, or object clitics, all of which receive an H tone. Field data reveal a systematic process of tonal dissimilation between the tonic syllables, most frequently involving pitch upstepping of the clitic, and less frequently downstepping of the clitic. This systematic pitch dissimilation, not found elsewhere in Palenquero (including other phrase-final combinations of successive tonic syllables that do not involve clitics), suggests the operation of the Obligatory Contour Principle, in turn pointing to the emergence of an H tone lexically attached to Palenquero enclitics.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.315.07lip,Romance Linguistics 2009,,978-90-272-4833-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2011930593&site=ehost-live,2010,11/8/19 21:39,11/8/19 21:45,111-127,111,127,16,"xiv, 426",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 315,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,18,"<p>Accession Number: 2011930593.

Traditionally, Catalan alveolar laterals have been described as being “dark”, i.e. velarized, while (Peninsular) Spanish laterals have been described a “clear”, i.e. non-velarized. Thus, it could be hypothesized that Catalan-dominant bilinguals speaking Spanish would tend to use velarized laterals. However, some recent literature has shown that velarization is a receding feature in Majorcan Spanish with young Catalan-dominant bilinguals leaning towards the use of clear variants. This paper discusses acoustic data gathered from several groups of Majorcan speakers, classified as a function of their dominant language, age and gender. The results indicate that all these three factors affect the degree of velarization of laterals, with Catalan-dominant bilinguals using more velarized variants, and younger subjects (especially females) using the least velarized variants.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.315.05sim,Romance Linguistics 2009,,978-90-272-4833-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2011930591&site=ehost-live,2010,11/8/19 21:39,11/8/19 21:44,81-94,81,94,13,"xiv, 426",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 315,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,8,"<p>Accession Number: 2011930591.

We outline the etymological origins of these consonants, some of which are shared by the two languages. One class of Portuguese palatal nasals arose from a nasalized palatal approximant – the phonetic leftovers of a historical process (typical of Galician-Portuguese but not Spanish) that nasalized vowels and deleted intervocalic alveolar nasal consonants. Some descriptions of Brazilian Portuguese suggest that this nasalized approximant is still extant and perhaps even dominant among speakers of the modern language. We compare the articulation of palatal nasals in a variety of vocalic contexts to determine the degree of impedance. We find evidence suggesting that the nasalized approximant of medieval Galician-Portuguese may have been retained in Brazilian Portuguese. This highly conservative trait appears to have spread throughout the lexicon even to etymologically unrelated forms and may be the reason for attested asymmetries in coarticulation among BP nasal consonants.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.315.03sho,Romance Linguistics 2009,,978-90-272-4833-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2011930589&site=ehost-live,2010,11/8/19 21:39,11/8/19 21:44,43-61,43,61,18,"xiv, 426",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 315,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,3,"<p>Accession Number: 2011930589.

Sixty existing words were inserted in a carrier sentence, each containing /a/ in word-initial unstressed position, and /a/ or /i/ in word-medial unstressed and word-final stressed positions. Acoustic measurements taken at the midpoint of vowels showed that /a/ in word-initial position was less fronted and more open than /a/ in word-medial position when the vowels were followed by a final front vowel. The degree of fronting of /a/ word-initially was greater when the vowel was followed by a front vowel in both medial and final positions. These results suggest that vowel-to-vowel assimilation in trisyllabic words in French is a gradient and local effect of the final front stressed vowel on the vowel immediately adjacent to it.

Anticausative derivations from typologically distinct languages, Hebrew and Neo-Aramaic (an ergative language) provide support for the analysis.

Typologically, the data is consistent with a number of other argument structure properties that characterise Medieval French as satellite-framed much like English and Dutch. I argue that the source of variation between Medieval and present-day French resides in a difference in the extended functional projection of prepositional elements.

For similar reasons (cf. Arteaga 2009), we also reject a CP analysis of bare subject restrictive relative clauses in favor of an IP analysis in which no null relative is proposed. Following (Trihn 2009), we adopt a copy account of these constructions, part of a general rule of syntactic derivation.

The plurals of singulars ending in a nasal avoid epenthesis if this requires parsing of a velar nasal in the onset.

In native words, instances of /i/ are predictable based on the surrounding phonological environment, indicating its original allophonic status. Borrowings from Slavic, however, show expansion of the phonological environments permitting /i/; and in Turkish loanwords /i/ appears in contexts lacking any phonological conditioning, indicating that at the time of borrowing, [i] was on the verge of phonemic contrast.

This paper presents the preliminary results of a study investigating the effect of the perceptual salience of four dialectal differences between two dialects of Spanish on the pattern of phonetic accommodation after exposure to another dialect in conversation. Accommodation is considered in two ways: the magnitude of the change and the direction of the change (convergence or divergence). Mixed effects models determine that there was a significant positive effect of perceptual salience on the magnitude of the change in that as perceptual salience increases, the magnitude of the change increases. In addition, there was a significant negative effect of perceptual salience on the direction of the change, in that as perceptual salience increases, the likelihood of converging decreases.

It proposes that velar fronting is driven by the feature [-back] (Calabrese 2005), while [+front] is involved in palatalization. When both features are involved concurrently, palatalization occurs in one step, as in Chilean Spanish. The analysis is formalized in Optimality Theory as the interaction of featural identity constraints for vocoids and non-vocoids (Faith-V, Faith-C) with agreement constraints specified for advancement (Agree [-back], Agree [+front]). The analysis assumes that diachronically, a stage of palatalization occurred between velar fronting and the emergence of palato-alveolar affricates. Both of these stages are motivated by increased coarticulation of velars to adjacent front vocoids. A later stage of coronalization is explained through the rise of a dispreference against palatals for articulatory, aerodynamic and perceptual reasons.

Specifically, the author proposes that (a) this class of verbs selects Possible Fact-denoting complements – complements whose truth is indeterminate and (b) simple Control clauses (like ECM and small clause complements) are tenseless; therefore, their index of evaluation must be lexically determined by the matrix verb (which precludes Possible Facts). Given this, Possible Facts must independently set up an index of evaluation via inflection of I for tense – fully inflected Is are well known to be associated with Nominative Case, precluding Control.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.333.17ree,Variations within and Across Romance Languages,,978-90-272-4852-7 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2015303491&site=ehost-live,2014,11/8/19 21:37,11/12/19 15:14,255-274,255,274,19,"viii, 426",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 333,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,1,<p>Accession Number: 2015303491.

We show that the degree of permeability observed in subjunctive clauses with respect to, e.g., wh-extraction is apparent, and is only indirectly related to the indicative/subjunctive alternation. We examine different verb classes in French and show that the behavior of various types of wh-phrases in extraction contexts is not directly linked to the mood of the embedded clause. We therefore propose (i) that the indicative-subjunctive distribution is a property of predicates that has to be distinguished from the property involved in complementizer selection. In a nutshell, in French, the subjunctive-indicative alternation can be accounted for in terms of the emotive–cognitive property of the matrix predicate; and (ii) that islands effects, that is, the degree of permeability of the embedded clauses can be related to the properties of the selected complementizer. In other words, the possibilities of extraction of a wh-phrase from an embedded clause can be accounted for by the size of the complementizer that acts as a more or less strong blocker for wh-extraction from the clause it selects. We therefore propose that mood ‘selection’ and complementizer selection are two independent properties of the main predicate.",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.333.16bau,Variations within and Across Romance Languages,,978-90-272-4852-7 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2015303490&site=ehost-live,2014,11/8/19 21:37,11/12/19 15:11,232-253,232,253,21,"viii, 426",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 333,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,3,<p>Accession Number: 2015303490.

A crosslinguistic comparison of clitics will show that although clitics come in different flavors either as phi-features or as determiners, they are all the result of an overt feature movement to repair violations of the Minimal Link Constraint (MLC) (Anagnostopoulou 2005). Raising constructions in Greek, Romanian and Spanish use clitic doubling as a strategy to avoid minimality effects. On the basis of a parallel between clitic doubling and Raising, I will conclude that they are the outcome of two different operations Move vs. (Long Distance) Agree but both are sensitive to MLC and are regulated by a phase-based locality condition (the Phase Impenetrability Condition).",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.333.15mar,Variations within and Across Romance Languages,,978-90-272-4852-7 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2015303489&site=ehost-live,2014,11/8/19 21:37,11/12/19 15:14,213-232,213,232,19,"viii, 426",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 333,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,2,<p>Accession Number: 2015303489.

In particular, this operation accounts for some word order patterns found in polar questions. In Romanian, polarity fronting is realized as head-movement of (V+)T+S to a higher peripheral head which bears a Focus-probe, which we identify as Fin. This licenses VS orders for predications in which VS is not allowed as a neutral order (i-level predicates, iteratives, generics). In Sardinian, an entire phrase headed by the lexical predicate (verbal non-finite form or non-verbal predicate) is fronted before the auxiliary. We argue that this order is obtained by two movement operations, head-raising of (V+)T+S to Foc and movement of the predicate phrase to SpecFoc. We also present the semantics of polarity focus, distinguishing several types of focus (informational, emphatic, contrastive).",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.333.13giu,Variations within and Across Romance Languages,,978-90-272-4852-7 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2015303487&site=ehost-live,2014,11/8/19 21:37,11/12/19 15:12,173-197,173,197,24,"viii, 426",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 333,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,5,<p>Accession Number: 2015303487.

Resulting from this is a direct interface between the phonological phrasing and the syntax. The intermediary of the prosodic component is thereby eliminated. Accordingly, it is emphasized that language is rhythmic and that the rhythm of any given language directly interprets the syntactic constituency. The instrument by which this is achieved is the rhythmic foot, which contravenes the syntactic constituency directly and restructures it to align it with the rhythmic patterning. In contrast to Nespor (1990), therefore, this approach takes into account no separation between the prosody and rhythm. As a result, it limits the need for pre-compiled rules as proposed by Hayes (1990).

The case of opacity by overapplication of /s/ aspiration in Spanish due to word- and phrasal-level resyllabification finds a straightforward explanation in those terms. The relative transparency of the aspiration process found in different dialects of Spanish is derived by the relative position that the markedness constraint CodaCondition occupies with respect to two families of constraints enforcing prosodification: Parse-Segment » Parse-ProsodicWord, and two morphology-prosody alignment constraints, Align-Left (Stem, ProsodicWord) » Align-Left (MorphologicalWord, ProsodicWord).",https://doi.org/10.1075/cilt.333.05tor,Variations within and Across Romance Languages,,978-90-272-4852-7 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2015303480&site=ehost-live,2014,11/8/19 21:37,11/8/19 21:37,39-62,39,62,23,"viii, 426",,,99948,Amsterdam Studies in the Theory and History of Linguistic Science IV: 333,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,,<p>Accession Number: 2015303480.

We will discuss the event structure underlying them and argue that, although it is commonly assumed that deadjectival nouns denote qualities (wisdom, beauty) or states (sadness, perplexity), there is a group of deadjectival nominalizations (imprudence, cruelty) that refer to occurrences of events (Beauseroy 2009). We show that such occurrential nominalizations are possible only when derived from evaluative adjectives. This is due, we argue, to the fact that such adjectives can be predicated of events in addition to the sentient individual (Stowell 1991). Finally, we show that the existence of a structure of origin with the relevant properties does not guarantee the existence of the derived category, leaving what seem to be gaps in the universe of possible derivations.",https://doi.org/10.1075/rllt.7.17arc,"Romance Linguistics 2012: Selected Papers from the 42nd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Cedar City, 2012",,978-90-272-0387-8 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2015751921&site=ehost-live,2015,11/12/19 15:07,11/12/19 15:07,261-274,261,274,13,,,,120314,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory: 7,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,,<p>Accession Number: 2015751921.

Within the adjectival participles, Kratzer (1994) and Embick (2004), for German and English respectively, distinguish between stative and resultative participles. Sleeman (2011) distinguishes two types of verbal participles in Germanic. She argues that the postnominal verbal participle in Dutch and English is fully eventive, while the prenominal one is not fully adjectival, as has been claimed by Embick (2004), but to a lesser extent eventive. In this paper, we claim that Romance languages also display the four stages in the adjectivization process. We argue that, not only in Germanic, but also in Romance, the less fully eventive verbal participle does exist, on the basis of an analysis of the French passive participle in combination with the adverb très “very” and the Romanian present participle in modifier position preceded by cel, a type of definite article selecting an adjective.",https://doi.org/10.1075/rllt.7.16sle,"Romance Linguistics 2012: Selected Papers from the 42nd Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages, Cedar City, 2012",,978-90-272-0387-8 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2015751920&site=ehost-live,2015,11/12/19 15:07,11/12/19 15:08,245-259,245,259,14,,,,120314,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory: 7,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,1,<p>Accession Number: 2015751920.

In this paper we focus on the apparent differences between this language and other Romance languages, and on the structure that bare nominals have in this language. We argue basically for a Determiner Phrase (DP) analysis in which Number features are morphosyntactically specified on Determiners (as in French), i.e. on D, even if D is null. We show that BNs in this language may correspond to NPs and to DPs. As NPs, they are not specified for number and definiteness, can only occur as objects of a restricted class of predicates, and are interpreted as property-type expressions. As DPs, they have a null D that carries Number specification, introduce a discourse referent and are interpreted as entity-type expressions.

In particular, on the basis of morphological evidence, I will argue that clusters are formed via a process of root incorporation. Evidence supporting this view comes from both diachronic and synchronic data. Diachronically, I argue that the emergence of cluster configurations resulted in a change reversing the order of certain clitic combinations (roughly, from accusative > dative to dative > accusative).

Significant differences were found for each vowel pair for at least one speaker, though considerable inter-speaker variation was evident. The most robust differences were tongue-body raising during the nasal vowels /ã/ and /ũ/. Because heavy nasalization tends to raise the perceived quality of low vowels, the lingual raising of /ã/ probably reinforces its nasality and contributes to the description of this vowel as [ɐ].

It is not unreasonable to assume that Palenqueros psycholinguistically partition Spanish and Palenquero, that they are able to identify given configur-ations as belonging to either Spanish or Palenquero, and that utterances con-taining both quintessentially Palenquero and uniquely Spanish structures will be acknowledged as mixed.

Typological considerations and the quest for universals make a case for the covalence of deixis and indexicality. This human language scenario exceeds the descriptive power of narrow syntax (Chomsky, 2008), hence inviting the encoding of indexical elements in the functional phase of syntax CP (Giorgi 2010). This paper proposes an operator-variable binding theory of ‘the deictic hypothesis’ (DH), where the human context (i.e. the intentional Speaker) is encoded as an operator in the (functional) CP phase, binding the deictic variable in the (content) vP phase. DH assumes a human cognitive foundation of the deictic act as a conceptual necessity. Under DH the person category in morpho-syntax is derived, while accounting for covalent indexicality. The empirical feasibility of DH is explored for Marsican’s Latin origin and its cognitive relevance projected for further research in the acquisition of deictic elements in similar language types (e.g. Basque, Korean).",https://doi.org/10.1075/rllt.9.21sal,Romance Linguistics 2013,,978-90-272-0389-2 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2016712024&site=ehost-live,2016,11/8/19 21:35,11/8/19 21:35,399-413,399,413,14,"xix, 418",,,120314,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory: 9,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,0,"<p>Accession Number: 2016712024.

The second part of the chapter focuses on the behaviour of third person dative clitics when combined with another third person clitic. In this context, (Gallo-)Romance varieties exhibit a number of irregularities and two possible orders: accusative > datives (as in both old and modern French), or dative > accusative (as in many French vernaculars). Moreover, in both medieval and present-day dialects, the accusative clitic is frequently dropped when clustered with a third person dative clitic.

This paper invites examination of the alternative view, namely: what we observe in second-generation bilingual Latinos is not errors, as they are frequently described in the literature, but rather points of divergence between their Spanish and that of the previous generation, due to normal intergenerational language change accelerated by conditions of language contact. The notion of incomplete acquisition rests on an incorrect view of child language acquisition as a process of perfect reproduction of parental grammars. But the process is one where children engage in grammar construction through hypothesis testing. Consequently, all next-generation grammars end up somewhat different from parental ones, paving the way for language change. The grammars of U.S.-born Latinos are thus, like all next-generation grammars, different, not incomplete. Examining the use of subjunctives for a brief illustration, grammarians regularly note variability in cases like Quizás venga (subjunctive) ~ Quizás viene (indicative) but obligatoriness in Quiero que lo llames (subjunctive), with the indicative alternative occurring seldom or never, and analyzable as ungrammatical, *Quiero que lo llamas (indicative). Second generation bilinguals have extended variability, so that for them the latter is usable, and analyzable as grammatical, a fact that disables these bilinguals from successful participation in experiments centered on somebody else’s grammaticality judgments, leading to conclusions of incompleteness.",https://doi.org/10.1075/rllt.9.16oth,Romance Linguistics 2013,,978-90-272-0389-2 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2016712019&site=ehost-live,2016,11/8/19 21:35,11/12/19 15:16,301-319,301,319,18,"xix, 418",,,120314,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory: 9,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,33,"<p>Accession Number: 2016712019.

These sentences were extracted from the MCVF parsed corpus of Old and Middle French. The first part of the article examines the size of the fronted element. It is shown that the fronted element may contain a single head, or it may be a full VP or a partial VP. It is argued that (remnant) VP movement accounts for the set of examples. In the second part of the paper, it is shown that the fronted constituent does not target a single position. In some cases, it occupies an IP-scrambling position between the subject in its canonical position and the finite verb; in a smaller number of cases, it is scrambled to the left of the subject. The fronted constituent is also attested within the left periphery, generally in Spec,FinP, but when the participle is contrastive or otherwise focalized, it could be analyzed a occupying Spec,FocP. The French facts are discussed in a cross-linguistic perspective.",https://doi.org/10.1075/rllt.9.12lab,Romance Linguistics 2013,,978-90-272-0389-2 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2016712015&site=ehost-live,2016,11/8/19 21:35,11/12/19 15:19,213-232,213,232,19,"xix, 418",,,120314,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory: 9,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,5,"<p>Accession Number: 2016712015.

This analysis is untenable for BP, as this variety has been losing categorical null referential subjects since the 19th century. The analysis that will be pursued here, for both BP and EP, is an adaptation of the one proposed in Holmberg (2001) for Finnish, according to which, in simple affirmative answers, which consists of just the inflected verb, the verb moves to a pre-sentential position, followed by Remnant TP-Ellipsis.

Absolute adjectives are evaluated with respect to a comparison class composed of counterparts (stages) of an individual, so that the property they express must be interpreted as subject to variation. Therefore, the inference of temporal persistence which seems to be at the basis of the individual-level character of predicates does not arise, giving rise to the stage-level interpretation that absolute adjectives receive. The inference of temporal persistence arises by default in the case of relative adjectives since in the comparison class selected by these adjectives there are no stages (of an individual) instantiating different degrees of the property but just different individuals manifesting different degrees of it. The inference of temporal persistence associated with relative adjectives makes the simultaneity constraint required by secondary predication contexts (McNally 1994) trivial and uninformative.

I argue that absence of agreement cannot be explained by an A-bar movement derivation, because Romanian TCs involve A-movement, the non-finite complement having passive properties. I also argue against an adverb analysis of Romanian tough-words and against a subject analysis of the clausal argument of the tough-word. I propose a novel analysis, which is supported by West Germanic data: non-agreeing TCs are multi-headed constituents, in which the adjective is the internal head, selecting the supine CP, and the supine C is the external head. Since the adjective is not the external head, it cannot take part in agreement relations involving the [Adjective+Supine] constituent. I provide a technical implementation of the notion of multi-headed constituents which relies on Citko’s (2008) flexible label projection: in this case, it is the label of the complement that projects (an instance of Project-Goal).

To provide an account for the distribution of parenthetical adverbs, I appeal to Giorgi (2011, to appear). I consider parentheticals as syntactically integrated structures, rejecting adjunction and adopting the cartographic approach, based on Kayne’s (1994) Linear Correspondence Axiom. As for the non-parenthetical occurrences, I propose that there are two basic positions for these adverbs, one for each phase: above v*P and above IP (Cinque’s position).

Second, we want to propose an analysis for SC that can account for this ambiguity and that is in accordance with current theories of modality such as Cinque (1999), Kratzer (1981, 1991), and Hacquard (2009, 2010). In a nutshell, we argue that SC can occupy two different positions, a low one below AspP, which corresponds to the abilitative interpretation, and a high one, above AspP, which translates as the epistemic reading.

These distributional changes of the innovative para—across its own contexts of occurrence as well as in its variation with the older por—demonstrate the crosslinguistic allative-to-purposive grammaticalization path. Frequent co-occurrence of the source elements, por and a, foments their coalescence, reflected in changes in the orthographic/phonological form of the fused preposition as it loses structural analyzability. Semantic compositionality, whereby there was a discernable semantic contribution of the allative a component, is also lost as early prepositional objects designating persons decline. We find this account of the rise of para, based on gradual loss of analyzability and compositionality, to be more compatible with the quantitative patterns and insightful than an opaque and implicitly abrupt notion of reanalysis.",https://doi.org/10.1075/rllt.9.03bau,Romance Linguistics 2013,,978-90-272-0389-2 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2016712006&site=ehost-live,2016,11/8/19 21:35,11/12/19 15:17,39-58,39,58,19,"xix, 418",,,120314,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory: 9,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,1,"<p>Accession Number: 2016712006.

With previous research having found a robust differentiation in production between French schwa and the front mid rounded vowels by the final generation of Frenchville French speakers, we hypothesize that a former near-merger of these vowels enabled a subsequent demerger. The present analysis examines schwa and the mid vowels in interview data from the penultimate generation of Frenchville speakers and finds evidence for a near-merger, as the vowels are similar but not identical in duration and spectral quality.

The shape and sequence of the partial nominative clitic paradigms maps the progressive diachronic introduction of contrasts using underspecified monovalent features organized hierarchically to reflect implicational dependencies, following Harley & Ritter’s (2002) Feature Geometry.

Assuming that accusative clitics manifest exclusively an agreement morpheme and that dative clitics can be decomposed into an applicative morpheme and an optional agreement morpheme, we argue for a unified account of these structures as follows: The presence of the accusative clitic and obligatory agreement in the dative are reflexes of the realization of an agreement morpheme in the structure.

For example, the phrase la vaca ‘the cow’ might be realized as [la.'va.ka] in El Paso, Texas as opposed to the standard Mexican Spanish pronunciation [la.'βa.ka]. While a similar pronunciation is attested in some specific varieties, such as in New Mexican (Torres Cacoullos & Ferreira 2000) or Paraguayan (Lipski 1994) Spanish, it is otherwise rare in the Spanish speaking world, where the oral voiced labial phoneme /b/ is usually realized as a bilabial approximant [β], as in la vaca, or occlusive [b] consonant, as in cien vacas ‘one hundred cows’ [sjẽm.'ba.kas].The aim of the current paper is to establish if the Texas Spanish speakers from the corpus (1) produce an auditorily and visually perceptible distinction between [v] and [β]/[b], and (2) make an acoustic distinction between [v] and [β]/[b] that correlates with the perception of different categories. Furthermore, this investigation (3) analyzes the linguistic and social factors that condition the use of [v] versus [β] and [b]. The influence of the English language is a fundamental factor that must be taken into account; on the other hand, the realization of /b/ as the voiced labiodental allophone [v] might be an archaism inherited from Old Spanish and preserved in West Texas dialects.In pursuing these research aims, 850 tokens from video-recorded interviews with 17 participants were submitted to auditory, visual, and acoustic analysis.

Evidence is given to support the view that such scls are purely syntactic entities, whose distribution is governed only by syntactic factors. The analysis leads to a re-casting of vocalic auxiliary scls as “be-scls,” where the phonological structure of the auxiliary becomes irrelevant. Removing the phonological component from the explanation of the behavior of these syntactic elements further allows us to make fruitful connections with many other syntactic phenomena which would not otherwise have been seen.",https://doi.org/10.1075/rllt.12.15tor,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory 12,,978-90-272-0392-2 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2018750945&site=ehost-live,2017,11/8/19 21:33,11/8/19 21:33,235-258,235,258,23,"xi, 277",,,120314,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory: 12,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,0,"<p>Accession Number: 2018750945.

Overall, innovative features that registered in the two datasets are qualitatively the same. Results confirm an increase in the frequency of innovative features related to second language acquisition and language contact at all linguist levels, with particularly high diffusion rates of morphological simplifications.

The study focuses on L1 Spanish speakers who are acquiring Palenquero as L2, since when switching from the gender-agreeing L1 to the gender-less L2, the persistence or absence of gender agreement in cognate items can be taken as an indirect measure of the cost differential between producing morphosyntactic agreement and suppressing the carryover of obligatory agreement to the L2. The results of experiments conducted with bilingual Spanish-Palenquero speakers in San Basilio de Palenque, Colombia reveal the tenacity of Spanish gender agreement among L2 Palenquero speakers; heritage Palenquero speakers’ retention of gender agreement falls between traditional speakers and L2 speakers.",https://doi.org/10.1075/rllt.12.09lip,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory 12,,978-90-272-0392-2 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2018750940&site=ehost-live,2017,11/8/19 21:33,11/12/19 21:08,127-140,127,140,13,"xi, 277",,,120314,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory: 12,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,3,"<p>Accession Number: 2018750940.

It assumes that word-word compounds in BP correspond to composite groups, the prosodic domain between the phonological word and the phonological phrase proposed by Vogel (2008, 2009), based on the observation that word-word compounds display phonological behaviour that is distinct from the behaviour of both regular words (i.e., non-compounds) and other composite structures in the language. The preliminary experiment involved the production of sentences containing complex compounds with left adjunction, complex compounds with right adjunction, coordinate compounds and coordinate phrases by native speakers of BP (n = 3). The results indicate that compounds with adjunction have specific acoustic profiles, which differ from the acoustic profile of both coordinate compounds and phrases.

Drawing on specific tests, I show that such anaphors must be anteceded by logophoric centers, specifically either by attitude holders or by empathy loci. This generalization is explained if we suppose the existence of silent logophoric operators that corefer with the antecedent and locally bind the anaphor: apparently exempt anaphors are in fact not exempt. This accounts for why they have the same form as anaphors standardly obeying Condition A: they are one and the same element.

In the analysis proposed, the particles are propositional operators and require that the truth of a proposition p* fail to persist through a temporal succession of epistemic states, this proposition being incompatible with the prejacent, and that the interlocutors share knowledge of a previous epistemic attitude toward p*. We analyze two main cases (plan-related and non plan-related propositions) and also show that these particles are indexical to one (or more) epistemic agent(s) and allow for shifts in perspective.",https://doi.org/10.1075/rllt.12.01ama,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory 12,,978-90-272-0392-2 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2018750931&site=ehost-live,2017,11/8/19 21:33,11/12/19 21:06,1-13,1,13,12,"xi, 277",,,120314,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory: 12,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,5,"<p>Accession Number: 2018750931.

Romance languages offer an opportunity to address this question since closely related languages are proposed to be at different ends of the typology. We test two such languages: European Spanish (ES) and Brazilian Portuguese (BP). Instead of investigating isochrony per se, however, we examine the interface between timing and prominence properties. Since duration is associated with prominence, we test the hypothesis that syllable-timed languages (ES) do not alter duration to express prominence, while non-syllable-timed languages (BP) do. Comparisons of lexical and sentential prominence effects on duration support our hypothesis, confirming the proposed distinction between the rhythmic classes of the two languages.",https://doi.org/10.1075/rllt.14.19vog,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory,,978-90-272-0097-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2018710938&site=ehost-live,2018,11/8/19 21:32,11/12/19 21:11,325-340,325,340,15,"vii, 345",,,120314,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory: 14,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,1,"<p>Accession Number: 2018710938.

I argue that the syntactic analyses put forth so far are not superior to previous morphophonological accounts.

That demonstrative structure also plays a role in asymmetries that hold concerning the possible silence, in certain cases, of third person pronouns, but not first or second person pronouns. HCI shares with past participle agreement the property that it is incompatible with an unmoved lexical direct object, in a way that presents a challenge to Agree, if Agree is taken to be available even in the absence of movement.

These findings provide support for previous syntactic analyses that argue for differences between information-seeking and echo-questions on one side, and echo-repetition and echo-surprise questions on the other.",https://doi.org/10.1075/rllt.14.06gon,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory,,978-90-272-0097-6 (hbk.),,http://ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2018710925&site=ehost-live,2018,11/8/19 21:32,11/8/19 21:32,85-102,85,102,17,"vii, 345",,,120314,Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory: 14,,,,mzh,EBSCOhost,,"<p>Accession Number: 2018710925.

I provide an analysis of the left periphery able to explain the observations concerning the distribution of ma, for instance that it must precede all other items in the clause and cannot be embedded. I propose that ma is a discourse head, projecting a syntactic structure analogous to that of normal syntactic heads. Discourse heads, however, connect separate sentences, which can also be uttered by different speakers, provided that they belong to the same context.

First, soi is a first-person oriented generic, expressing a generalization based on the discourse participants’ identification with the antecedent.

Shortening affects high vowels and /o/, and is favored by preceding and following voiceless consonants, and is most frequent in pretonic position and unstressed monosyllabic words.

A study of recursive nominal modification in Spanish show children acquire different types of modification (possession, part-whole relations) at different times even if these are expressed with the same preposition de. This suggest that the domain of rule formulation is narrower than syntactic category (PPs) or even lexical particle (de). Bilingual children show delays in acquiring a first level of embedding rule but not in allowing the rule to be recursive. This suggests that learning recursive modification is not sensitive to the concomitant reductions in input in bilingual contexts.

We examine the referential values of nosotros in clauses marked with different topics and foci regarding the inclusive/exclusive interpretation of the pronoun. We observe, contra Posio (2012), that overt nosotros doesn’t always involve exclusivity. The exclusive interpretation of the pronoun is nonetheless required in contexts typically declarative and non-contrastive (i.e., out-of-the-blue, thetic), and its overt use is perceived as odd if the Addressee is intended to be included. In Aboutness-Shift Topic and Given Topic contexts the clusive interpretation of the pronoun is obtained from the immediate context (i.e., whether the Addressee is active). Similarly, contrastive topics or foci include the presence of the Addressee in the immediate context as one of their points of contrast. To account for the influence of the immediate context on the interpretation of the pronominal values of clusivity we propose an analysis based on the projection of a Speech Act Phrase (SAP) (Speas & Tenny 2003) in combination with a Logophoric Center (Bianchi 2003) above the clausal left periphery (CP). In our analysis, the pronoun nosotros has an [Addressee] feature that is valued according to the availability of the Addressee in the left-most left periphery.

We also demonstrate that whenever an exceptive appears within a prepositional phrase, it is unable to take sentential scope. We provide three pieces of evidence that support this conclusion. First, PP-internal exceptives go hand in hand with the obligatory absence of the (optional) sentential negative scope marker ne. Second, PP-internal exceptives, unlike their PP-external counterparts, are unable to scope over modals in the clause in which they appear. Third, PP-internal exceptives, unlike their PP-external counterparts, do not license negative concord readings when they co-occur with a clause-mate n-word. These properties reveal the existence of a novel constraint that is not easily subsumed under existing theories of scope.

Using older and contemporary Picard written data, as well as contemporary oral data, we show that, even though Picard and colloquial French use the two forms, the two languages differ. Contrary to colloquial French, where 1pl usage has become marginal, 1pl remains widely used in Picard. Our analysis of semantic reference (restricted, specific unrestricted, or general unrestricted group) indicates that 3sg is primarily associated with general unrestricted reference in Picard and is barely used to refer to restricted groups. Most interestingly, the relative frequency of the two variants remains stable over time. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of considering linguistic conditioning through the comparative method for assessing language change in typologically related varieties, especially when testing claims that a minority language is converging toward its dominant counterpart.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7525094,A half century of Romance linguistics: Selected proceedings of the 50th Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages,978-3-96110-405-5 (pdf),,10.5281/zenodo.7525084,,2023,2/17/23,,21-40,21,40,19,,,,,Open Romance Linguistics,Language Science Press,,,,,,,,,,"Bullock, Barbara E.; Russi, Cinzia; Toribio, Almeida Jacqueline ",LSRL 50,The University of Texas at Austin,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

The aim of this paper is to discuss the nature of the optionality of RNSs. The case of the null generic subjects, partially attested in BP, and of null expletives are not under discussion. Using the macro-parametric view of the NS Parameter, we will make a joint discussion of both the possibility of RNSs and of free inversion in present BP. With regard to the latter, we will propose first that partial loss of free inversion has to be relativized in terms of prosodic weight. With regard to the former, we propose that optional RNS is felicitous when a sentence has a linear V2 (non-Germanic) pattern at PF, with the presence of a short cliticized element, which includes the subject pronoun. In both cases, we claim that BP has a filter at PF (Avoid V1).",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7525096,A half century of Romance linguistics: Selected proceedings of the 50th Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages,978-3-96110-405-5 (pdf),,10.5281/zenodo.7525084,,2023,2/17/23,,41-62,41,62,21,,,,,Open Romance Linguistics,Language Science Press,,,,,,,,,,"Bullock, Barbara E.; Russi, Cinzia; Toribio, Almeida Jacqueline ",LSRL 50,The University of Texas at Austin,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

It explores the possibility of an antipassive (AP) analysis, thereby adding a Romance perspective to the growing research of the historical development of the AP. The pronominal constructions of the sample that select an oblique complement display structural characteristics typical of the AP. Namely, they contain a demoted logical object, are structurally intransitive and semantically transitive, mark the oblique using the preposition di, display a detransitivizing “AP morpheme” si, and have a transitive counterpart.

It is argued that in European Spanish the attested alternation between agreement and lack of agreement is part of a single grammar, i.e. a case of intra-speaker optionality. To support this claim it is shown that neither definiteness nor Case assignment are responsible for the lack of agreement pattern. The proposal combines two basic ingredients: the special featural configuration of SE (Mendikoetxea 1999, D’Alessandro 2008) and the parametrization of the order of syntactic operations (Obata et al. 2015, Obata & Epstein 2016).

A challenge to this generalization arises in Spanish. In Spanish, in-situ full DP objects and postverbal object clitics conform to the established pattern of objects not being able to establish control into an adjunct. However, I present novel data showing that when an object clitic is preverbal, it can control the subject position of a non-finite temporal adjunct. Moreover, when a clitic can control into an adjunct, subject control is not ruled out; there can be ambiguity between the choice of controller. I show how this data can be accounted for following the two-tiered theory of control. I account for the optionality between a subject or preverbal clitic controller by distinguishing between two available positions for the clitic within vP.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7525102,A half century of Romance linguistics: Selected proceedings of the 50th Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages,978-3-96110-405-5 (pdf),,10.5281/zenodo.7525084,,2023,2/17/23,,107-130,107,130,23,,,,,Open Romance Linguistics,Language Science Press,,,,,,,,,,"Bullock, Barbara E.; Russi, Cinzia; Toribio, Almeida Jacqueline ",LSRL 50,The University of Texas at Austin,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

This generalization is challenged by Colombian Spanish non-finite adjuncts, which allow both overt subjects and referentially free null subjects. We uncover an intricate pattern of distribution and interpretation along two criteria: Obligatory vs. Non- Obligatory Control (OC vs. NOC) and whether the controllee is silent or an obligatory-controlled overt pronoun (covert vs. so-called “overt PRO”). The distribution of sloppy readings with null subjects provides arguments for analyzing NOC as DP-ellipsis. We also show that both covert and overt PRO display the canonical diagnostics of OC except in one context. While they both only allow bound variable construals under ellipsis, overt PRO also allows co-reference when its controller is associated with focus. This paradox follows on the assumption that while both null and overt anaphors must be syntactically bound, only null anaphors are necessarily semantically bound.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7525104,A half century of Romance linguistics: Selected proceedings of the 50th Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages,978-3-96110-405-5 (pdf),,10.5281/zenodo.7525084,,2023,2/17/23,,131-156,131,156,25,,,,,Open Romance Linguistics,Language Science Press,,,,,,,,,,"Bullock, Barbara E.; Russi, Cinzia; Toribio, Almeida Jacqueline ",LSRL 50,The University of Texas at Austin,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

The first set of data comes from Romance data where superlative import requires relativization, whereas the second set has more generally to do with relative clauses in subject position of specificational sentences. The problem comes down to what follows. Under Q+D, a conflict emerges between the assumed syntax of the post-copular clause and its interpretation. That is, the structural configuration required to satisfy Binding or NPI licensing cannot generate the desired (superlative) interpretation, at least not without relying on mysterious implicatures.

The primary objectives are to investigate the potential role of a social group-based accommodation effect in the acquisition of non-target-like speech and to identify any unique features in the French intonation contours of French immersion versus core French speakers. To such ends, two groups of six Anglophone learners of French having graduated from either a French immersion or a core French program completed a social identity questionnaire and a delayed sentence repetition task. The questionnaire results suggest that French immersion speakers have greater ingroup identification with their French program than their core French counterparts, particularly as concerns their emotional and psychological attachment to their program and peers. Due to the small sample size, differences in the French intonation contours of these learner groups were not significant and require further investigation. The results of this study expand our understanding of the role of sociological factors in the present instance social identity as a potential difference between L2 learner groups, and it is the first study to suggest a potential interaction between social identity and the production of linguistic features in an L2 context.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7525112,A half century of Romance linguistics: Selected proceedings of the 50th Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages,978-3-96110-405-5 (pdf),,10.5281/zenodo.7525084,,2023,2/17/23,,221-248,221,248,27,,,,,Open Romance Linguistics,Language Science Press,,,,,,,,,,"Bullock, Barbara E.; Russi, Cinzia; Toribio, Almeida Jacqueline ",LSRL 50,The University of Texas at Austin,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

However, the general lack of studies aimed at observing Catalan contact-induced changes in Spanish is an oversight of bidirectionality as an expectation of language contact. Accordingly, the present study uses both Catalan and Spanish mid front vowel production data from Barcelona to investigate the roles of age, gender, and language dominance in the processes of assimilation (Catalan cognate effects in Spanish) and dissimilation (distinctly produced cross-linguistic mid front vowel categories). While no cognate effect was observed in Spanish, younger speakers maintain less distinction between Catalan mid front vowel categories than older speakers, and females have less overlap between Spanish /e/ and Catalan /E/ than males. These results are consistent with a male-led change towards greater assimilation and more overlapping productions of all three mid front vowel categories. While cognitive factors such as language dominance and cognate status are central to models of bilingual phonetic representation, it is paramount to situate the bilingual individual within the context of the community and acknowledge the external social factors which also mediate variation in acquisition and production.",https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7525114,A half century of Romance linguistics: Selected proceedings of the 50th Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages,978-3-96110-405-5 (pdf),,10.5281/zenodo.7525084,,2023,2/17/23,,249-268,249,268,19,,,,,Open Romance Linguistics,Language Science Press,,,,,,,,,,"Bullock, Barbara E.; Russi, Cinzia; Toribio, Almeida Jacqueline ",LSRL 50,The University of Texas at Austin,Linguistic Symposium on Romance Languages

A total of 280 sentences from a contextualized elicitation task were analyzed in Praat following SpToBI conventions. Results show that INF and SUR have similar melodic contours, involving a rise through the first pre-nuclear accent, declination, and a steep final rise on the wh-phrase. However, SUR questions have a higher nuclear peak and larger focal tonal range than INF questions.
